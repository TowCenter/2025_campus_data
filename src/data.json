    "content": "Dear Stanford Community,\n\nAs we begin the quarter, we look ahead to the joys of spring on the Stanford campus, with its warmth and energy. We also have a sharp focus on the federal policy issues challenging the university, and we want to share a few principles that are guiding our approach.\n\nFirst, we are committed to the university’s fundamental mission of research and education in our decisions, policies, and financial priorities. We are advocating for the importance of federal research funding that drives national scientific leadership and innovation. We are also preparing for how to sustain excellence in multiple budget scenarios, including maintaining continuity in financial support for graduate and undergraduate students. Stanford is a resilient institution, full of problem-solvers. We are confident that we will be able to address whatever challenges come and find creative solutions.\n\nSecond, academic freedom and a culture of open inquiry are at the core of Stanford’s ability to fulfill our mission of research and education. Universities thrive when faculty and students invite and confront competing ideas and arguments. We have made it a primary focus this year to nurture that ideal: from clearer time, place, and manner rules on free speech, to the e Pluribus initiative, to new programs to support a strong civic culture. And we are committed to defending the right of faculty and students to research and discuss issues they care about, free from internal and external coercion.\n\nThird, a defining strength of the university is to bring together students and faculty with different ideas, backgrounds, and aspirations, to create a community of scholars who enhance each other’s learning. Stanford functions best when we have compassion for the needs of others. We are sponsoring town halls to address uncertainty about science funding, providing resources and information for our international students, and addressing many other timely issues. When we work together, there is so much to celebrate: just last quarter, the completion of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Camera, the Civic Learning Week National Forum, the opening of the CoDa building for interdisciplinary data science, and our first ACC conference title, won by the women’s gymnastics team.\n\nFinally, we are advocating, in public and private settings, for the value of universities – for open minds, for discovery, for learning. The creativity, dynamism, and leadership of this country depend on the strength of American universities. Our excellence derives from the investment of public as well as private resources. We are at a time when opportunities for discovery and global competition make that commitment vital. So it is essential that we address criticisms with reflection and humility, and restore public trust.\n\nThe success of universities also rests on the American ideal of the open exploration of ideas, a culture of freedom, and horizons of opportunity for all. At its best, Stanford epitomizes that spirit and we are committed to sustaining the campus as a place where, in the words of our motto, the wind of freedom blows.\n\nJon Levin\n\nPresident\n\nJenny Martinez\n\nProvost",

    "content": "On March 18, 2024, the Provost charged the AI at Stanford Advisory Committee to assess the role of AI at Stanford in administration, education, and research to identify potential policy gaps and other needs to advance the responsible use of AI at Stanford. The committee met seven times between March 18 and June 19 to assess potential policy gaps in the areas of administration, education, and research at Stanford. They were informed by reports, policies, and resources from peer institutions that have assessed similar questions over the last year (e.g. Cornell, Michigan, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton).\n\nStanford and the Rapidly Changing Landscape of AI Use\n\nThere are great opportunities and great challenges associated with the newest generation of AI technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). They represent powerful transformative tools for productivity because of their ability to generate/draft, summarize, and analyze text, images and other media. At the same time, they are new and have not systematically been assessed (for example, with respect to biases within the data used to train them, and their performance on critical tasks that are fact-based). Their attractive output may lull users into a misplaced sense of quality, precision, and accuracy. Most importantly, these technologies are rapidly evolving in both their capabilities and the degree to which they can be inspected, tested, verified and validated. And, while such models continue to improve, their already-known shortcomings require that care be taken when using these systems in many contexts.\n\nStanford is a leader in the development and application of AI. The university community includes experts in the creation, validation and extension of the core capabilities of AI. Across all schools and units, many colleagues are already using AI to advance teaching and research in their disciplines. Therefore, it seems prudent to articulate a core set of policies, standards, and best practices for the use of AI in the administrative, educational and research functions of the university. A fine balance is required. The committee wishes to encourage experimentation with the technology as it evolves, to maximally benefit the university, the research enterprise, and teaching and learning, while ensuring that key principles of the university are honored. Thus, our group approached its charge through the lens of providing guardrails to support productive uses of AI and not to stifle innovation, creativity or exploration.\n\nPer its charge, the committee sought to identify potential policy gaps. We list these, along with other considerations and recommendations for university activities in administration, education and research. Given the pace of change in the AI field, the committee cautions against creating fixed, rigid policies (except where required by law or other compelling considerations). Rather, we recommend the adoption of approaches that are flexible and do not unduly limit the creative use of AI to support the university’s mission. In some cases, policies are not required—guidelines and best practices will suffice and provide more flexibility. At a minimum, any best practices, standards or policies promulgated by the university should be evaluated and updated regularly based on their relevance and effectiveness.\n\nThe committee also arrived at a set of general principles to help guide the approach to AI, since many situations and challenges may not be anticipated in advance. These principles should help guide the ad hoc management of new issues as they arise. Our group learned that there are hundreds of uses of AI each day conducted by faculty, staff, students/trainees. General principles to help guide these “experiments” may be more useful to individual users and practitioners than any policy to cover the specific situations and use cases that we were able to anticipate and describe below. Of course, consultation with the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is important when potential legal issues arise.\n\nGuiding Principles for AI at Stanford[1]\n\nWe encourage the university to view goals in this space in line with the philosophy of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to make sure that the use of AI is centered on improving the human condition. Thus, we prefer to focus on “augmenting human capabilities” versus “replacing humans.” Many of us at Stanford aspire towards a goal where AI positively impacts our community. We must take into consideration the fair distribution of benefits that come from AI. We seek to remove or repair AI systems that tend to harm individuals or groups disproportionately. For critical systems affecting human health and welfare, we aspire for a high bar for validation and verification of AI accuracy, applicability, fairness, and equity before deployment. Moreover, we should resist the tendency to assume that existing laws, regulations, and university policies are not applicable in the context of AI use, a tendency we call “AI exceptionalism.” In short, we believe that the use of AI at Stanford should be human-centered.\n\nWe modify from a Cornell report a review of the elements of human-centeredness to formulate the following guiding principles that we can strive towards in our deployment of AI at Stanford:\n\nHuman Oversight. Humans should take responsibility for the AI systems used or created at Stanford. Each system should aim to have a clear line of authority and responsibility for system procurement/creation, maintenance, monitoring and sunsetting. There should be plans for re-engaging human control of systems when they do not work, and there should be contingency plans for management of high-risk AI systems.\n\nHuman Alignment. AI systems should be built/procured to support Stanford’s mission and core values. When appropriate, systems should be adopted and deployed in consultation with diverse stakeholders to identify risks and mitigation strategies–particularly for disparate negative impacts. The scope of use, system capabilities, and limitations of systems should be documented in an ongoing process and evaluated regularly for consistency with community standards.\n\nHuman Professionalism. All members of the Stanford community should adhere to standards and aim for high levels of rigor and quality in their work. We expect that they will exercise their best judgment and critical thinking in the use of AI tools. All community members are responsible for the content of our work and must be willing to take responsibility for that work, regardless of whether it was assisted by AI. They are also responsible for the quality of reasoning and veracity of assumptions that underlie the work. Community members are also responsible for abiding by applicable laws, university policies, and must consider the expectations and norms within the multiple professional communities to which they belong.[2]\n\nEthical and Safe Use. AI should be used to improve university functions. Decision makers should aim to understand the full implication of using AI systems in university functions and should embark upon evaluations when these implications are not fully understood. All community members should aspire to ensure that AI services promote justice and individual autonomy and are free from bias and unlawful discrimination.[3] The community should have processes for identifying and decommissioning previously deployed AI systems that are not safe and/or ethical.\n\nPrivacy, Security, and Confidentiality. When AI systems use personal data (especially sensitive data, as defined by law or common practice), the legality and impact should be appropriately assessed. If personal data is used for decision-making by AI systems, Stanford should reasonably aim to be transparent about how the decisions are made, whether they are inspectable and the degree to which they have been validated and verified independently. Some uses of data or application of AI systems may require consent, such as attorney-client privileged information, medical records and psychotherapist-patient information. Generative AI tools (such as Open AI and Chat GPT) save, reuse, and share the information entered with their affiliates including confidential or sensitive information. Any confidential or legally privileged information of Stanford or a third-party may not be provided to generative AI tools.\n\nData Quality and Control. All data used to create new AI systems with university resources should be collected in legal and ethical ways, and data provenance should be explicitly documented and managed as part of the system design. The university should consider building and maintaining a world class data-centric infrastructure that prospectively plans for data use in AI across the research lifecycle. AI systems should be tested and their risks documented. Technical and organizational controls should mitigate the risk of interference or exploitation by bad actors.\n\nAn AI Golden Rule. During a time of great change in the capabilities and uses of AI, it may be useful to “use or share AI outputs as you would have others use or share AI output with you.” One test would be for an individual to consider if they would be comfortable if the roles of AI user and recipient were reversed. Another test might be for an AI user to consider whether they would be willing to transparently disclose the details of their use with those affected by the AI output. These assessments would likely change over time, and would be based on individual judgements as well as evolving community norms for use of AI. They would be combined with the other principles to inform decision making about the use of AI.\n\nPolicy Areas\n\nWhile surveying the current uses and activities related to AI at Stanford, the committee found some critical areas that may require further guidance and support from the university. Appropriate groups (indicated where possible) may wish to evaluate the need for, and content of, additional policies related to the use of AI in conducting Stanford activities.\n\nAI in university administration processes\n\nHiring. There are concerns of bias and risk of litigation around the use of AI to review, screen or filter applicants for jobs or roles at the university. There is also concern about bias in the use of AI to prepare job descriptions and job ads. (University Human Resources.)\n\nPerformance Reviews. The use of AI in the generation of performance review materials may raise issues of trust and staff morale, and should be managed very carefully. In addition, there may be legal implications to AI-generated materials in performance reviews. (University Human Resources.)\n\nAdmissions. Like hiring, the use and influence of AI in admissions decisions and application review at the undergraduate and graduate level raise concerns around bias, risk of litigation, and reputational harm. The committee recommends not using generative AI in the admissions process without careful and documented assessment of the performance of these systems. We recognize that AI may be helpful in creating communication materials for recruitment, but it is important to use it carefully in ways consistent with the guiding principles articulated above. (Faculty Senate Committees on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid and Graduate Studies.)\n\nCommunications. Staff in communications roles across the university may need guidance in the appropriate use of AI for generating university content. (University Communications.)\n\nSurveillance. Any data collection about the activities of members of the Stanford community is a potential threat to privacy, confidentiality, personal autonomy and the trust between the university and the members. At the same time, some of these technologies may be useful for tracking student classroom attendance. Therefore, there should be guidance on the procedure for deciding on surveillance, the expectations for transparency (including potentially consent), the expectations for data management, maintenance and deletion. (University Privacy Office and the Faculty Senate Committee on Academic Computing and Information Systems.)\n\nOther recommendations and considerations:\n\nEducation and training on sensitive data. Existing data security and privacy policies for computing resources cover many of the uses of AI services. However, there may be a sense that AI tools are exceptional or are not covered by these rules. For example, it is easy to paste text into ChatGPT and then forget that it might be inappropriate to provide sensitive university data to an external entity (like OpenAI) except under clearly prescribed conditions. The university should consider methods to inform university community members with access to these data of these risks.\n\nUniversity-provided access to LLMs. There are equity issues in access to LLMs, because they can be expensive and thus access across faculty, staff, students/trainees may be uneven. At the same time, most of the major vendors of LLMs are not transparent about the data used to train their models, and the models may not have been evaluated systematically for bias, fairness, precision or accuracy. The committee supports investigation into ways to make access to these tools more balanced, while offering choice and asking vendors to help characterize their products beyond “see what you think.” If LLMs are provided by the university, the committee sees an opportunity for education about how to use them and how to be wary of their outputs.\n\nVision for AI and staffing. It is our view that the best use cases of AI are where they help and enable staff in their work. The university should consider describing its vision for AI systems to augment and not replace staff work, and to emphasize ethical issues and ways that these should be mitigated. Staff may be especially concerned about job loss in the context of AI, and so the university leadership may want to consider how a vision of “augment do not replace” might be adopted. Such a policy should be complemented by readily available education in how staff (and others) can use AI to augment their work. (University Human Resources.)\n\nStreamlined procurement process. It is clear that Stanford community members are using Stanford resources to purchase AI systems for a variety of purposes. This is consistent with the vision of experimentation and testing of AI. However, it also may create risks for the university if the procured software is not consistent with the guiding principles we outlined above (e.g. professional activities of staff are captured and saved, student information is captured, surveillance data is used for non-Stanford purposes). The committee recommends that high risk software be identified and evaluated, so that the community can learn about AI without subjecting community members to risks that violate our guiding principles.\n\nA website to communicate guidelines and resources to the community. The university should continue to expand web resources that provide the Stanford community with easy access to information about AI resources, policies, and other supporting information. UIT’s GenAI website currently provides a central site with easy navigation to the HAI and Responsible AI websites while presenting an overview of gen AI to the broader Stanford audience. The site’s GenAI Evaluation Matrix helps Stanford community members understand the risk classifications for many commonly used GenAI tools. Collectively, pages like these may provide resources to improve AI literacy and present approaches for engaging with gen AI platforms while raising awareness about security and privacy concerns in order to use AI most productively.\n\nLetters of recommendation. Letters of evaluation and recommendation are key to academic advancement, hiring and promotions. These letters ideally contain honest and original descriptions of candidate activities, and so the use of AI to generate text as a substantial component of letters of recommendation could have unintended impacts—such as recipients recognizing that the letter was produced with AI and thereby diminishing the value and weight of the letter. At the same time, an AI-generated letter as a first draft followed by substantial editing and preservation of original descriptions and detailed (often coded) evaluation language could lead to the more rapid creation of high-quality, accurate, personalized and useful letters. The committee recognizes that faculty have a large number of letters to write annually for a variety of purposes, and so generative AI may have some utility, if used appropriately. The AI Golden rule may be a useful principle in these activities.\n\nApplications of AI to support education\n\nAssessment and grading. The committee sees several potential risks in use of AI software to grade, assess, detect plagiarism, or provide feedback on student work, including (but not limited to) quality, accuracy, fairness, and potential bias. In addition, there are potential privacy concerns when using third-party tools and any FERPA implications. This is another rapidly evolving area, and it seems prudent to recommend or require instructor disclosures and justifications when AI is used for student assessment or student feedback. (Faculty Senate Committees on Undergraduate Standards and Policy and Graduate Studies.)\n\nStudent use of AI. Students have generally been early adopters, particularly of generative AI for writing–as well as other uses. They are preparing for careers where AI will likely be ubiquitous and increasingly powerful. The committee recognizes that there is an existing Honor Code policy about the use of AI. This should be examined for revision or updating; some faculty have found the guidance unclear, while students and others have also voiced that the policy is unenforceable and therefore not effective or useful. AI should be considered in the context of evolving changes to the Stanford Honor Code. Given predominant concerns about cheating, it may also be valuable to provide finer distinctions in the ways students (and faculty) may use AI to support their work, for example as a source of ideas or feedback versus a wholescale use of AI to take or grade exams or homework. Policies may be quite different for different uses of AI for learning. (Board on Conduct Affairs.)\n\nOther recommendations and considerations:\n\nAccommodations. The committee recognizes that AI tools have the potential to be tools to address issues of accessible education. This is a complex topic that goes to the heart of how accessible education should be approached and requires careful deliberation on ensuring optimal educational and learning goals, while considering equity and applicable laws.\n\nSandbox for users. The committee noted multiple concerns about the lack of university-sanctioned AI services, guided training programs, and best practices may have deterred Stanford workers from experimenting with AI for their job (administration, education, research). This is particularly acute in administration where efficiencies may be found, and education where instructors and students are interested in learning how to best use the tools. The university should consider offering a makerspace, sandbox, or other setting where community members can experiment with AI tools. For example, the Graduate School of Education has created an “AI Tinkery” (a digital maker space), where educators can explore different AI tools with the help of dedicated staff, who also provide regular workshops. (Center for Teaching and Learning and Learning and Technology Services could provide a makerspace open to all instructors, utilizing Stanford’s AI Playground.)\n\nAccess to some LLM tool for all students/campus. The issue of universal access to one or more LLM tools for student equity came up repeatedly in our discussions and is related to the Sandbox consideration above. Student access to AI and LLMs is a fundamental but difficult issue. At a minimum, access to LLMs may be considered as an educational cost (like textbooks) in financial aid and “cost of college” calculations. There should be a process for determining the process for evaluating, procuring and distributing site licenses for current and future LLMs. Issues of evaluation–accuracy, precision, validation, verification will likely become increasingly prominent in such decisions. (University IT.)\n\nResources for teaching with AI. There is considerable variability across fields and between individual faculty in how best to approach teaching with AI. The university should consider providing frameworks and worked-out examples to help instructors think through all aspects of pedagogy impacted by AI (assessment, 1:1 tutoring, the definition of cheating and its detection). For example, a selection of sample course policies in addition to the existing training resources and workshops on offer through CTL and the Stanford Accelerator for Learning in the GSE is sponsoring seed grants and community events on the development of new AI-infused pedagogies. (Leverage expertise in the Graduate School of Education together with the Center for Teaching and Learning.)\n\nLicense for plagiarism checkers. Access to plagiarism checking software for researchers is increasingly required for author self-checking against inadvertent and unintentional plagiarism. (Stanford Libraries.)\n\nUses of AI in research\n\nAuthorship. The university’s current policy on authorship, written at a time where multi-disciplinary research was growing, may be due for an update to address potential issues around attribution between individual authors and AI. Although journals, publishers, and the government will no doubt create policies around this, Stanford should aim to have basic statements of authorship consistent with academic values, processes, and assessment of merit. In particular, the risk of quoting text beyond currently acceptable academic standards is present in some of the current LLMs and requires author professionalism. (The Vice Provost and Dean of Research and the Faculty Senate Committee on Research.)\n\nMisconduct. AI tools, in particular AI plagiarism detectors, are already leading to a higher volume of allegations (including spurious allegations), and this creates a huge burden on university resources in adjudicating these allegations. The university’s current misconduct policy and rules for investigating individual allegations will need to be re-evaluated and updated in accordance with the new federal policy.[4] (The Vice Provost and Dean of Research.)\n\nReview and writing of proposals. There is a growing prevalence of AI content in research proposals and reviews of research proposals. Grant agencies are developing rules around such uses of AI; the university may similarly consider its own policy or supplement existing guidance. Whereas the use of AI in brainstorming, copy-editing or otherwise refining grant proposals may be very useful, the use of AI as a proxy reviewer may violate fundamental academic standards.\n\nTraining AI on student work. There are active and exciting efforts to train AI systems to provide tutoring and evaluation of student work. These systems often require large amounts of student work for training, and the use of student work-product without permission and appropriate approval processes may be inappropriate or even illegal in some cases. (SDOC, the Student Data Oversight Committee, should provide guidelines on appropriate use of student data for AI research.)\n\nOversight on using data for AI research. AI research often involves the use of large amounts of training data which may have legal and/or ethical concerns. Given that much of health AI research is exempt from IRB review under federal regulations, the university should clarify the process for reviewing and providing support for responsible and compliant use of data. (The Vice Provost and Dean of Research.)\n\nOther recommendations and considerations:\n\nLegal issues. As mentioned above, there may be a tendency to think of AI as an exception to existing laws, rules, and university policies; in the research sphere. Examples of risk areas include copyright and trademark infringement disputes (e.g. when curating and distributing datasets for AI that contains copyrighted work), breach of contractual agreements (e.g. violating our agreement with data owners), potential tort and defamation liabilities (e.g. if the AI tools produce fake, or harmful information or advice), and violation of privacy rights of others and related regulations (e.g. using or sharing PHI or other personal data in violation of existing policies and protocols, or failing to obtain adequate consents to use personal data). Litigation risk will continue to shift to the users of AI (as opposed to the initial focus on developers) as the use of this technology becomes more commonplace. Researchers should be reminded or made aware of risks and obligations in contexts where AI is used for research and updated as the legal risk profile changes.\n\nComputing support for campus AI. The university should consider ways to expand computing resources to enable AI-powered research and experimentation to ensure that Stanford administrators, educators and researchers remain leaders in the productive and human-centered use of these technologies.\n\nAI at Stanford Advisory Committee members:\n\nRuss Altman, Kenneth Fong Professor and Professor of Bioengineering, of Genetics, of Medicine, of Biomedical Data Science, and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for HAI (Committee Chair)\n\nYi-An Chen, Senior University Counsel\n\nMichele Elam, William Robertson Coe Professor of Humanities and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for HAI\n\nZephyr Frank, Gildred Professor of Latin American Studies and Professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability\n\nSteve Gallagher, Chief Information Officer, University IT\n\nStephanie Kalfayan, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs\n\nSerena Rao, Senior Associate Dean for Finance and Administration, VPDOR\n\nMehran Sahami, Tencent Chair of the of the Computer Science Department and James and Ellenor Chesebrough Professor\n\nDan Schwartz, Dean of the Graduate School of Education\n\nZack Al-Witri, Assistant Vice Provost for Academic Affairs (Staff to the Committee)\n\n[1] Examples of other related guiding principles and resources:\n\n[2] These policies and expectations, as we recommend below, ought to be clearly communicated to the Stanford community and accessible through an online portal.\n\n[3] HHS recently issued rules for healthcare providers to follow to make sure decision-making systems (such as AI tools) are non-discriminatory. eCFR :: 45 CFR 92.210 — Nondiscrimination in the use of patient care decision support tool. While the rules are intended to apply to patient care settings, it may provide a helpful framework to consider for evaluation of responsible use of AI in decision making generally.\n\n[4] The Office of Research Integrity under the US Department of Health and Human Services has recently published the rule on research misconduct.",

    "content": "Update on University Response to Federal Measures\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nIn recent weeks, you have read and heard a lot about various federal actions and how they impact Northwestern and higher education in general. We write today to update you on the challenges the University faces and how we are responding.\n\nThis is a critical moment for our institution, in which many of our foundational values are being tested. We know many of you are feeling this acutely, and we are too. We remain steadfast in our unwavering dedication to our research enterprise, to academic freedom and to creating an environment in which the best minds from across the globe can come to teach, learn and push the boundaries of discovery for the betterment of humanity.\n\nAlthough we still have not received official notification or details from the federal government that our federal research funding has been frozen, nor the conditions that would restore funding, we already have seen significant impacts.\n\nAs of this writing, we have received 98 stop-work orders, mostly for Department of Defense-funded research projects, in addition to 51 grant terminations that were mostly received prior to the news of the funding freeze. In addition, we have not received payments for National Institutes of Health grants since March. These now appear to be frozen.\n\nThis is deeply troubling, and we are working in many ways to advocate on behalf of the University and to resolve the situation.\n\nAs we announced earlier this month, in support of our faculty, students and staff during this period of uncertainty, the University, after consultation with the Board of Trustees, will support research that is subject to stop-work orders or the federal funding freeze. This support is intended to keep these projects going until we have a better understanding of the funding landscape. We expect and hope to recoup the costs of this research once federal funding is restored. However, this commitment places significant financial stress on the University and is not a permanent solution. New guidance for this interim support will be shared with faculty soon.\n\nIn addition, the University is exploring ways to help researchers whose grants have been terminated by the federal government.\n\nThis is just one part of our multi-pronged approach. We are working hard to understand what we can do to “unfreeze” our grant funding. This means meetings with key legislative leaders, collaboration with peer universities, coordination with organizations like the American Association of Universities and seeking legal representation to learn about our options to find a sustainable path forward that enables us to continue doing the life-changing research, teaching and scholarship we are here for. The Board of Trustees remains deeply involved in supporting these efforts.\n\nWe hear frequently from many of you asking what you can do to help. First and foremost, we must continue to do the incredible teaching, research and scholarship we do every day. Despite the many pressures we are under, the work you do has never been more vital, and our mission has not changed: to produce world-changing research, to create new knowledge and to push creative expression and practical application.\n\nWe also encourage you to advocate on behalf of Northwestern and higher education. We recently launched a new webpage dedicated to our research and the impact it has on society. Share it with friends, colleagues — anyone who you think should know why federally funded research is important.\n\nWe expect additional challenges ahead. As we have written about previously, the University already is facing financial pressures, and there are proposals in Washington to reduce the Facilities and Administration rates (F&A) on all federal grants, as well as legislation that could increase the tax on our endowment and other issues.\n\nThere is a lot of work to be done, and our goal is to keep you informed and engaged. We will only get through this if we work together. We understand that many members of our community are justifiably concerned about the future.\n\nTo help faculty, students and staff better understand the issues as well as institutional guidance and resources, we have enhanced and retitled the Responding to Federal Policies webpage, which now includes more information about research funding, travel, immigration and other issues.\n\nWe encourage you to bookmark this site and check it regularly. We cannot communicate about every development in this complicated landscape, but we will continue to update this website as events dictate to provide as much clarity as we are able.\n\nThere is no greater test for a community than how it responds in the face of adversity. We are grateful for your partnership, your hard work and your care for our institution. In the weeks and months ahead, we look forward to working with you as we continue our path as one of the world’s leading academic institutions.",

    "content": "Enabling Vital Research to Continue\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community\n\nIt has been more than a week since news reports surfaced that the federal government plans to freeze a significant portion of our federal research funding. Although we still have not received official notice of such action, we have received stop-work orders on roughly 100 federal grants, money that fuels important scientific breakthroughs.\n\nThis research is foundational to Northwestern’s mission of bringing together the sharpest minds from around the globe to make the world healthier, safer and a better place for future generations.\n\nWe are grateful to the dedicated faculty, staff and students who work tirelessly in our labs and classrooms. To support them in this period of uncertainty, the University, after consultation with the Board of Trustees, will fund research that is subject to stop-work orders or the federal funding freeze. This support is intended to keep these projects going until we have a better understanding of the funding landscape. The supported research does not include projects that were previously terminated by the federal government.\n\nWe continue to urge fiscal responsibility, including the conservative use of funds to help minimize University risk and extend the time that Northwestern can support our research community.\n\nThe work we do is essential to our community, to the nation and to the world. Enabling this vital research to continue is among our most important priorities, and supporting our researchers in this moment is a responsibility we take seriously.\n\nExamples of our research impact are highlighted on a new webpage launched yesterday, which showcases some of our most promising work.\n\nWe continue to be heartened by the resilience of our community, and how, despite myriad challenges, so many of you have been able to remain focused on what we do best — improving the lives of those around us.",

The review will culminate in an on-site visit to the Evanston campus April 28 and 29 by a team of HLC peer reviewers.\n\nFaculty, students and staff are invited to meet with the peer review team during a series of open forums to be held Monday, April 28, and Tuesday, April 29. A list of the open forums, including their dates, times and locations, can be found on the Office of the Provost website.\n\nNorthwestern has recently submitted to the HLC a report, the institution’s “assurance argument,” that aims to demonstrate how Northwestern meets all five HLC criteria for accreditation. During the upcoming site visit, the peer review team will validate claims made in the materials submitted and seek to deepen their understanding of Northwestern through engaging with faculty, students and staff. I encourage all members of the University community to consider participating in these sessions. You can find the assurance argument and other materials to help you prepare for participation in the site visit on the Office of the Provost website.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming the HLC peer review team to Evanston and using this opportunity to reflect on and showcase Northwestern’s ongoing efforts to foster excellent teaching, innovative research, and the personal and intellectual growth of our students.\n\nThank you for your participation in this process.",

    "content": "An Update on This Morning’s Vandalism\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nEarly this morning, a group of individuals vandalized several buildings on our Evanston campus, spray-painting antisemitic slogans and hate-filled language. The fact that these acts occurred during the commencement of the Passover holiday makes these disgusting statements all the more despicable.\n\nAntisemitic acts cannot and will not be tolerated at Northwestern, nor will vandalism or other violations of our policies on displays, demonstrations or conduct.\n\nWe are working systematically and utilizing camera footage, forensics and other methods to identify the individuals responsible for this vandalism. If these individuals are current Northwestern students, they will be immediately suspended and face full disciplinary proceedings under University policies, as well as criminal charges under the law.\n\nHours before this vandalism took place, I hosted a seder in my home in celebration of Passover, at which we discussed that amid the many challenges we face as a University and as a society, there is optimism and hope for our days ahead. That remains true despite the actions of a few who work to erode that hope.\n\nLate last month, we published a Progress Report on University Efforts to Combat Antisemitism. As a University, we should take pride in the progress we have made over the past year, but we can never become complacent. In that report and in many communications prior, we made abundantly clear that violations of our rules and policies will result in strict enforcement and that antisemitic behavior will be met with consequences.\n\nAs we work to identify the individuals who committed this morning’s hateful act, I ask members of the community to come forward with any information that could be helpful in solving this case by calling University Police at 847-491-3456 or filing a report online with the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX Compliance. Both can be done anonymously.",

We have received more than 100 stop work orders this week for projects funded by the government — primarily impacting researchers in Feinberg, McCormick and Weinberg. The affected grants include research into wearable devices, robotics, nanotechnology, foreign military training, Parkinson’s disease and many other critical research programs supporting our nation.\n\nThese developments are deeply disturbing. They impact the critical research we perform every day, the lives of those who do it and those who benefit from it. They also cut to the core of what makes Northwestern one of the world’s greatest universities.\n\nThis situation is changing rapidly, but we are working quickly and deliberately to gather facts to help us understand and respond to this emerging crisis. We are in constant communication with our Board of Trustees, with administrative leaders across the University and with leaders at peer institutions and in the government.\n\nWe are developing options for how best to support our research enterprise, including the faculty and staff who make it possible. In doing this, we seek to balance our commitments to our community, the guiding principles we articulated last month and the University’s financial support for impactful research.\n\nWe will continue to provide updates as we are able, as we work to better understand the scope of the challenges in front of us.\n\nThank you for your dedication, your commitment and your contributions to Northwestern during these uncertain times.",

    "content": "Resources Related to Federal Action on Immigration and Travel\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nA series of recent high-profile immigration actions taken against students and scholars around the United States plus persistent speculation about possible travel restrictions have understandably shaken members of the Northwestern community, particularly our international students, faculty and staff.\n\nThere are many conversations about what these actions mean for higher education and what similar activity here could mean for the academic mission of Northwestern, a global institution that welcomes students, scholars and staff from all over the world. Northwestern’s international students and scholars bring with them perspectives and experiences that are critical to our shared academic success. We cannot do our best work without attracting the best minds from around the world.\n\nWe write to you today to share the guidance and resources that are currently available while we continue to monitor the evolving federal activities and potential policy actions related to immigration and international travel.\n\nGuidance on engaging with federal officials\n\nIf you or someone you know is approached by a federal officer on or off campus, the most efficient way to alert the University is to call Northwestern Police at (847) 491-3456. Please describe the situation to the dispatcher, who will then notify the appropriate University officials. If the agent produces identification and a signed warrant, comply with their order. Bystanders should remain calm and not interfere and instead relay the events to the dispatcher or University official onsite.\n\nThe University will follow the law. At the same time, we will work to ensure the rights of each member of our community and will connect them with appropriate assistance, when necessary, to help protect those rights.\n\nSome have asked if the University will provide legal protection for members of our community who are detained as part of the federal government’s immigration and travel actions. We encourage anyone with legal questions about such situations to reach out to an immigration attorney.\n\nGuidance related to travel\n\nRecently, the U.S. Secretary of State announced that the Department of State is revoking visas. In addition, news outlets have reported on potential travel restrictions currently under consideration. Our international community members are advised to be aware of these and future developments as they consider any international travel and are encouraged to review information about appropriate documentation and guidance on re-entry to the United States. Students and scholars with questions about their Northwestern-affiliated immigration status should contact the Office of International Students and Scholars at intoff@northwestern.edu or (847) 491-5613.\n\nStudents planning University-sponsored international travel should review the international travel registry homepage for instructions and eligibility criteria. Faculty and staff traveling on University business are strongly encouraged to book their travel through one of Northwestern’s contracted travel agencies.\n\nResources available to students, staff and faculty\n\nWe know that many members of our community are experiencing increased anxiety. Northwestern offers a number of wellness resources for those who need help or are in a crisis.\n\nNUhelp is a guide for students navigating Northwestern's safety, crisis and wellness resources. View a summary roadmap of your options.\n\nNUGuardian is a free app for students to enhance their personal safety by designating phone contacts as “guardians” who walk (virtually) with them.\n\nStaff and faculty can access the Northwestern Employee Assistance Program for support.\n\nWe understand this time is filled with worry and uncertainty. Northwestern takes these concerns very seriously, and we will continue to provide information as we are able.",

    "content": "Staying True to Our Guiding Principles\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nThe events of the past two months have left many in our community stunned and uncertain about the future of higher education in our nation and our ability as a university to effectively pursue our joint mission of research and teaching. Between the threats to our budget coming from the proposed reduction of Facilities and Administration charges and proposals to increase the tax on our endowment returns, to restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “holds” on federal research grants, many of us are quite literally trying to catch our breath.\n\nAll of this is in the backdrop of a U.S. Department of Education investigation of Northwestern and several other universities as well as a Department of Justice task force visit that was announced last week.\n\nWhile the scope of Executive Orders, agency guidance and other measures from the federal government has been wide-ranging, a common theme through many of them has been the potential penalties that colleges and universities face — specifically, the loss of federal funding for our students and faculty that would fundamentally undermine our ability to fulfill our mission.\n\nWe write today not to detail plans for dealing with all these challenges. Things are changing day-to-day, and quite honestly, we don’t have all the answers yet. But we are working hard to develop strategies to protect our University and its ability to achieve its mission. We commit to responding to whatever challenges come our way in a thoughtful, deliberative and inclusive way.\n\nOur purpose today is to let each of you know what some of our guiding principles will be as we make the many hard decisions in front of us.\n\nWe share with you a fierce commitment to academic freedom. We will defend the rights of our faculty to determine the content of their scholarship and their courses. Restrictions on academic freedom undermine the purpose of the university — the search for truth and enlightenment and the transmission of knowledge to our students and future generations.\n\nWe value free expression and vigorous debate. We wholeheartedly endorse the August 2024 statement of the President’s Advisory Committee on Free Expression and Institutional Speech, which states, in part, “[w]hether in concert with prevailing wisdom or in defiance of it, Northwestern University faculty and students have wide-ranging liberty to pursue their scholarly, pedagogical, intellectual and artistic activities.”\n\nWe believe that all students, faculty and staff deserve to be free from discrimination, hate and intimidation. We must, through our rules, practices and teaching, promote a culture of respect and community that furthers engagement and the free flow of ideas.\n\nWe believe that the diversity of our University — bringing together students, faculty and staff from different backgrounds, viewpoints and communities — is essential to our mission of teaching and research. It is only through engagement across difference that we can obtain the full transformative benefit of a great residential university. Furthermore, we can maximize the potential of our remarkably diverse community only if we ensure that every one of our members is valued, supported and feels a part of Northwestern.\n\nWe believe in access and opportunity regardless of socioeconomic status. Neither of us would be here today without the help of others who opened the doors to college. Higher education is the springboard for mobility and community empowerment, and we want to share that experience with future generations.\n\nWe pursue excellence in every part of the University and never lose sight of our ambition to forever be among the greatest research universities in the world. As we work through what promises to be a challenging fiscal future, we will always keep this in mind.\n\nWe believe that research is essential to the future welfare and competitiveness of our nation and the world. We will vigorously advocate for continued government investment in research and innovation. In periods of public retrenchment, we will seek support from other partners including industry and philanthropy.\n\nWe believe in and will adhere to the rule of law, but we also will use our collective voice in partnership with our fellow universities to promote higher education policies and practices that are in line with these values.\n\nWe both have an abiding optimism about the role our University plays and can continue to play in building civil society. There will be ebbs and flows in human progress, but higher education will always be its driving force. Both of us understand that it is a privilege to participate in the leadership of this amazing and vital institution.",

    "content": "Responding to Challenging Issues\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nThe federal government has issued Executive Orders and related agency actions at an unprecedented pace in recent weeks. The path forward on these interconnected issues is frequently complex and often unclear, and we recognize the toll that uncertainty takes on our faculty, staff and students. As guidance is issued and clarified, we are taking the necessary time to evaluate the rules and respond carefully and thoughtfully.\n\nAmong the most recent developments, the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued guidance late Friday about how educational institutions, including Northwestern, must implement federal law with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. This guidance followed a Jan. 21 Executive Order titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,” which prohibits federal funding for organizations deemed to be discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\n\nThe Executive Order and OCR letter state that DEI programs and policies are no longer allowed in educational settings and that institutions that do not comply could lose federal funding. In part, the OCR letter reads:\n\n“The law is clear: treating students different on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent. ... Federal law thus prohibits covered entities from using race in decisions pertaining to admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies and all other aspects of student, academic and campus life.”\n\nThe letter goes on to say that the Department of Education will “vigorously” enforce the law with respect to all educational institutions that receive federal assistance.\n\nThe federal government provides Northwestern hundreds of millions of dollars every year in student financial aid (Pell grants) and research grants. We currently are analyzing the Executive Order and OCR letter and their potential impacts on the University. As we do that review, we bear in mind that our choices could have major impacts on the University community. In the days and weeks ahead, Northwestern leaders will work with members of our community to assess and, in some cases, implement changes.\n\nAs we take actions to protect our University community, we remain committed to making decisions consistent with our core academic values and principles. These include our mission to attract and support exceptional students, faculty and staff from a wide variety of backgrounds, perspectives and geographies who will learn from one another and contribute to research that changes the world.\n\nAs we bring these exceptional people to our campuses, we also believe that it is important for all members of our community to feel that they belong here and thereby can flourish and do their best work. Because we are committed to bringing together people of different backgrounds and perspectives, this may require a variety of different support mechanisms responsive to the needs of our community, including academic counseling, student and employee groups, community building and programmatic activity. Every member of our community should feel welcome at any of these or other University activities regardless of their socioeconomic status, political viewpoint or protected characteristic, such as religion, race, national origin or gender.\n\nThe role of the University is to provide members of our community the tools to discover for themselves what they believe in and opportunities for realization of those beliefs. Our commitment to learning from one another means the University needs to adopt programs that expose people to views that are different from their own and give them opportunities to engage respectfully across difference. Through our new Center for Enlightened Disagreement, we are developing these opportunities and spreading evidence-based best practices through our research.\n\nThis is an unprecedented time for American higher education and for Northwestern. We are confident that by working together, we will successfully navigate the changes coming our way and continue the remarkable trajectory of excellence we have experienced over the past several decades.",

    "content": "Immediate Measures to Address Financial Challenges\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nEarlier this year, our annual financial update enumerated some of the potential challenges that lie ahead, including:\n\nConstraints on tuition and endowment payout revenues\n\nIncreased expenses related to labor contracts and employee benefits\n\nFederal legislation, potential changes in federal policy, compliance, research administration, security and litigation\n\nSince then, we have seen these challenges emerge in a variety of ways, including a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) announcement we communicated about on Monday that could have a profound and damaging effect on federally funded research across the country. In addition, Congress continues to discuss proposals to dramatically increase the tax on university endowments.\n\nWhile the federal directives coming out of Washington, D.C., are rapidly evolving, in some cases unclear and subject to legal challenges, it is clear that Northwestern and our peer schools could suffer significant financial repercussions.\n\nAny one of these measures could have a substantial impact on our budget. For example, one proposal to increase the endowment tax from 1.4% to 14%, if enacted, could result in a more than $70 million budget impact for Northwestern. And although NIH’s recent guidance is now suspended due to legal challenges, the proposed cap on cost recovery would result in a reduction of more than $100 million in funding annually to support research at the University.\n\nAfter consultation with University leaders and Board of Trustees leadership, we have decided to take the following measures, effective immediately, to protect Northwestern and to best position the institution amid these myriad challenges.\n\nFirst, all personnel actions, including hiring, compensation increases, additional payments and other related actions will be reviewed centrally to ensure they are necessary to the operation of the University and the pursuit of our mission of teaching and research. Previously approved faculty hiring will not be affected for this year, but all other open positions at the University, including ones that have already been posted, will be reviewed centrally to determine their necessity.\n\nSecond, we will limit current spending by reducing non-personnel expense budgets in the current fiscal year by 10%. This will be managed in close partnership with school and unit leadership.\n\nThird, expenditures or financial commitments greater than $25,000 will require pre-approval by the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We encourage all faculty and staff to exercise prudence in your requests given the current financial uncertainty.\n\nIn the next few days, we will disseminate guidance and procedures that will help units understand these new protocols.\n\nThese measures will impact almost every part of our University in some way. We regret that some of the plans and aspirations of members of our community may be constrained, at least for now. While we are doing all we can to advocate for and protect our community, we feel it is necessary to take these steps until further notice to help ensure Northwestern is best positioned to navigate this period of uncertainty without permanent damage to our operations or mission.\n\nThe work we do is vital. On our campuses, we educate the next generation of leaders, we produce groundbreaking research that changes the world, and we push the boundaries of discovery in ways few institutions can. As many of you have heard us say, if you care about the future, you need to care about higher education.\n\nWe will continue to advocate on behalf of Northwestern and, with our peers, on behalf of higher education in our country. We are confident that we will succeed because we must.\n\nWe truly appreciate your partnership and your dedication to our University.",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nThe 2023-24 academic year was disappointing and painful. I am sorry for the moments when we failed to meet the high expectations we rightfully set for our community. The grave, extensive impact of the October 7, 2023, Hamas assault on Israel and its aftermath had serious repercussions on our campus. Long-simmering tensions came to the surface and, as protests and sometimes violent clashes erupted on campuses across the country, members of our community reported incidents that led them to feel targeted and shunned on the basis of their identities. In response to these accounts, I established a pair of presidential task forces last year: one to address antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, another to address anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian bias. I asked the members of both task forces not only to examine recent events but also to ground their work in a broad historical context. Most importantly, I asked them to recommend approaches and actions that would help the University meet its obligation to create a community in which every one of us can thrive.\n\n\n\nI write today to share the Report of the Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias and the Report of the Task Force on Combating Anti-Muslim, Anti-Arab, and Anti-Palestinian Bias.\n\n\n\nThough the ambition of the task forces will be obvious to any reader, any attempt to explore the complex phenomena described in the reports will have shortcomings. Both reports note limitations of the survey of experiences of community members, and the authors acknowledge that they set out to listen to the concerns of the community, not to verify the reports of disturbing experiences. Notwithstanding these caveats, the conclusions that emerge from this work are clear. We need to recognize and act on them, and we are doing that.\n\n\n\nSeparately and together, the task force reports reveal aspects of a charged period in our recent history, offering searing personal accounts as they hold up a mirror to our interactions with one another. During the listening sessions that took place last spring, Jewish, Israeli, and Zionist community members reported experiencing our campus climate as unwelcoming. In some cases, they hid overt markers of their identities to avoid confrontation. Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, and pro-Palestinian community members reported feeling judged, misrepresented, and silenced. Some found our existing policies and practices wanting when they needed support or sought action. Across our community, some questioned how issues concerning Israel and Palestine were addressed on our campus, noting that they found some seminars and lectures, panel discussions, and events open to the public to be one-sided, deepening feelings of exclusion and rejection, and calling into question our institutional commitment to excellence and rigor in our academic pursuits.\n\n\n\nEspecially disturbing is the reported willingness of some students to treat each other with disdain rather than sympathy, eager to criticize and ostracize, particularly when afforded the anonymity and distance that social media provides. Some students reported being pushed by their peers to the periphery of campus life because of who they are or what they believe, eroding our shared sense of community in the process.\n\n\n\nHarvard cannot—and will not—abide bigotry. We will continue to provide for the safety and security of all members of our community and safeguard their freedom from harassment. We will redouble our efforts to ensure that the University is a place where ideas are welcomed, entertained, and contested in the spirit of seeking truth; where argument proceeds without sacrificing dignity; and where mutual respect is the norm. Especially when tensions are high, we must embrace the challenge of seeing one another as we truly are, unique individuals with complex beliefs and identities, leaving our preconceptions behind and meeting one another with kindness and concern.\n\n\n\nThe scope of recommendations made by the task forces underscores the breadth of the challenges we face. They must be addressed with determination at every level of the University by effectively tackling issues that arise where our students congregate or live; ensuring that expectations for both students and teachers in the classroom are clearly communicated and met; nurturing vibrant debate and open speech in ways that encourage everyone to express their ideas freely; preserving the right to protest and dissent while avoiding disruption, harassment, and threats; and, when our policies are violated, ensuring that our disciplinary processes are fair, consistent, and effective. If we intend to make significant and durable change across Harvard, it is critical that we act decisively in each of these areas.\n\n\n\nSince I assumed office in January 2024, we have made necessary changes and essential progress on many fronts. We have reiterated the rights and responsibilities we share, including time, place, and manner limitations on protest and dissent, and we have clarified expectations concerning the use of campus spaces. Both the principles outlined in the Report on Institutional Voice in the University, which limit official statements on public matters, and the recommendations of the Open Inquiry and Constructive Dialogue Working Group are being implemented to further the free and respectful exchange of ideas across the University.\n\n\n\nBuilding on that foundation, as well as efforts undertaken in response to preliminary recommendations made by each task force, the University’s Academic Council—the president, provost, deans, and other senior leaders—is further developing and implementing new recommendations. Our efforts are focused on nurturing a widespread sense of belonging and promoting respectful dialogue; revising and implementing policies, procedures, and training; and strengthening academic and residential life. It is essential that we equip our students with the skills and experiences that they need to engage complex issues fully, to have productive and civil dialogue with people whose backgrounds and identities differ from their own, and to meet all members of our community, especially those with whom they disagree, with open minds. More on these and other measures is included in our summary of work to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, and our summary of work to combat anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian bias, which will be updated as we continue to make progress.\n\n\n\nThe deans are reviewing recommendations concerning admissions, appointments, curriculum, and orientation and training programs, including those organized by recognized student groups, as they move toward implementation. They are also continuing to expand efforts already under way. I have asked them to share with me by the end of this term action plans designed for the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and each professional school. This effort will dovetail with our ongoing efforts to foster open inquiry and constructive dialogue. Building upon those connections will allow us to move forward with greater intention and speed across the University.\n\n\n\nThe Office of the President and Provost will oversee the implementation of recommendations that need to be coordinated at the University level. We will initiate a research project on antisemitism; support a comprehensive historical analysis of Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians at Harvard; and speed the establishment of a University-wide initiative to promote and support viewpoint diversity. In parallel, we are initiating further review of disciplinary policies and procedures to assess their effectiveness and efficiency, and are laying the groundwork to generate annual reports describing the University’s response to complaints of discrimination or harassment.\n\n\n\nI am deeply grateful to the members of both task forces, especially the co-chairs who led their efforts, for pursuing their work with a spirit of openness, empathy, and compassion during a period of unrest within our community. The reports are the product of strenuous, prolonged efforts by some of the most generous and dedicated citizens of our University. In carrying out their work, which was both time consuming and emotionally taxing, they shouldered extraordinary burdens. We should all commend them for their service to every one of us and to the University.\n\n\n\nMy goal now is to ensure that we continue to find ways to strengthen the fabric of our community as we meet unprecedented challenges. If the many ways in which we have come together as One Harvard over the past two weeks are any indication, we have every reason to be optimistic about our prospects. The good we do today and in the days to come is for all of us, but it will be experienced most profoundly by those who inherit Harvard from us. May our successors, whether they are Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, or of any combination of backgrounds and perspectives, find Harvard to be a place where they can be themselves, express their views freely, and encounter sympathy and understanding—a place where all are cheered on as they pursue their dreams.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M.

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nThe University-wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities (USRR) expresses our strong commitment to free speech, including the right to protest and dissent, as well as the rights of Harvard community members to learn, teach, research, live, and work without interference or disruption. These rights and responsibilities define our shared obligations to one another as members of the Harvard community.\n\nOver the past year, we have continued to examine how the University can uphold these rights and responsibilities for everyone in our community and provide greater consistency in addressing policy violations, including, where appropriate, through disciplinary proceedings. These considerations have been informed by important and substantive feedback from our community.\n\nAs a result of these considerations, the Governing Boards have approved a proposal that empowers the president to call on a faculty panel of the University Committee on Rights and Responsibilities (UCRR) to investigate, find facts, and impose discipline in cross-School cases involving alleged violations of the USRR or Campus Use Rules. As part of this change, the president will establish a process for creating and implementing procedures that will be reviewed at the end of two full academic years.\n\nOur effort builds on the University’s work over the last year to clarify further the rights and responsibilities we share while reaffirming free expression, mutual respect, and content-neutral enforcement. In January 2024, we clarified time, place, and manner guidance prohibiting protest, no matter the content, in our classrooms, libraries, dining halls, and residential spaces. Last summer, we published Campus Use Rules governing the shared use of common spaces across our campus grounds and buildings. In July, we took an interim step, enabling the UCRR to investigate and find facts, but not impose discipline, in cross-School cases.\n\nThe additional step we announce today is aligned with the foundational goals of the USRR, which has defined not only our rights but also our responsibilities to one another for more than half a century. These aspirations, though, can only be realized through the fair, effective, and consistent enforcement of disciplinary processes. In a growing number of cases, students from multiple Schools have participated in the same disruptive activity but received significantly different discipline. This outcome has not only raised concerns about evenhandedness but also made it more difficult for any Faculty to discipline their own students when they violate the rights of others.\n\nThe creation and implementation of new procedures is designed to ensure that disciplinary processes in cross-School cases treat like cases alike. Certainly, different consequences may be appropriate for similar conduct by a first-year undergraduate as opposed to a third-year professional school student. But no student should receive different discipline based on nothing more than the Harvard School(s) in which they are enrolled.\n\nWe will soon release provisional procedures to allow the UCRR to begin its work while we gather community input to inform more permanent procedures. Details will need to be worked out, but the procedures will be designed to ensure continued faculty agency in the disciplinary processes affecting their students and will ensure due process for all our students. We look forward to your input, and we are grateful for your cooperation as we work together toward building a more consistent and effective disciplinary process.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nOver the course of the past week, the federal government has taken several actions following Harvard’s refusal to comply with its illegal demands. Although some members of the administration have said their April 11 letter was sent by mistake, other statements and their actions suggest otherwise. Doubling down on the letter’s sweeping and intrusive demands—which would impose unprecedented and improper control over the University—the government has, in addition to the initial freeze of $2.2 billion in funding, considered taking steps to freeze an additional $1 billion in grants, initiated numerous investigations of Harvard’s operations, threatened the education of international students, and announced that it is considering a revocation of Harvard’s 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. These actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers, and the standing of American higher education in the world.\n\nMoments ago, we filed a lawsuit to halt the funding freeze because it is unlawful and beyond the government’s authority. I encourage you to read our complaint.\n\nThe consequences of the government’s overreach will be severe and long-lasting. Research that the government has put in jeopardy includes efforts to improve the prospects of children who survive cancer, to understand at the molecular level how cancer spreads throughout the body, to predict the spread of infectious disease outbreaks, and to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield. As opportunities to reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease are on the horizon, the government is slamming on the brakes. The victims will be future patients and their loved ones who will suffer the heartbreak of illnesses that might have been prevented or treated more effectively. Indiscriminately slashing medical, scientific, and technological research undermines the nation’s ability to save American lives, foster American success, and maintain America’s position as a global leader in innovation.\n\nThe government has cited the University’s response to antisemitism as a justification for its unlawful action. As a Jew and as an American, I know very well that there are valid concerns about rising antisemitism. To address it effectively requires understanding, intention, and vigilance. Harvard takes that work seriously. We will continue to fight hate with the urgency it demands as we fully comply with our obligations under the law. That is not only our legal responsibility. It is our moral imperative.\n\nBefore taking punitive action, the law requires that the federal government engage with us about the ways we are fighting and will continue to fight antisemitism. Instead, the government’s April 11 demands seek to control whom we hire and what we teach. Today, we stand for the values that have made American higher education a beacon for the world. We stand for the truth that colleges and universities across the country can embrace and honor their legal obligations and best fulfill their essential role in society without improper government intrusion. That is how we achieve academic excellence, safeguard open inquiry and freedom of speech, and conduct pioneering research—and how we advance the boundless exploration that propels our nation and its people into a better future.\n\nWe acknowledge that we have unfinished business. We need to ensure that the University lives up to its ideals by taking concrete steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and academic exploration; making changes to our disciplinary systems so they will be more consistent and more effective in ensuring that our students, faculty, and staff take responsibility for their actions; implementing measures to ensure that all members of our community are safe and respected; and adopting important adjustments to the ways we build community—continuing to focus on individuals and their unique characteristics rather than their race. In the days ahead, I will say more about our progress in each of these areas.\n\nWe will also soon release the reports of the Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias and the Task Force on Combating Anti-Muslim, Anti-Arab, and Anti-Palestinian Bias. I established these groups last year as part of our efforts to address intolerance in our community. The reports are hard-hitting and painful. They also include recommendations with concrete plans for implementation, which we welcome and embrace. No one in our community should experience bias, intolerance, or bigotry. We believe adoption of the recommendations and other measures will go far toward eradicating those evils on our campus.\n\nThe time ahead will demand much from each of us, but I am as confident as ever in our ability to meet our challenges with integrity and resolve, our minds set on the work before us and our hearts committed to the future of our beloved University.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nFor three-quarters of a century, the federal government has awarded grants and contracts to Harvard and other universities to help pay for work that, along with investments by the universities themselves, has led to groundbreaking innovations across a wide range of medical, engineering, and scientific fields. These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer. In recent weeks, the federal government has threatened its partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, over accusations of antisemitism on our campuses. These partnerships are among the most productive and beneficial in American history. New frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances—from treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes, to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum science and engineering, and numerous other areas of possibility. For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.\n\n\n\nLate Friday night, the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to “maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government.” It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner. Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the “intellectual conditions” at Harvard.\n\n\n\nI encourage you to read the letter to gain a fuller understanding of the unprecedented demands being made by the federal government to control the Harvard community. They include requirements to “audit” the viewpoints of our student body, faculty, staff, and to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their ideological views. We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\n\n\n\nThe administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\n\n\n\nOur motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened.\n\n\n\nWe have made it abundantly clear that we do not take lightly our moral duty to fight antisemitism. Over the past fifteen months, we have taken many steps to address antisemitism on our campus. We plan to do much more. As we defend Harvard, we will continue to:\n\nnurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on our campus; develop the tools, skills, and practices needed to engage constructively with one another; and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community;\n\naffirm the rights and responsibilities we share; respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring that protest occurs in a time, place, and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning, and research; and enhance the consistency and fairness of disciplinary processes; and\n\nwork together to find ways, consistent with law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects, and embraces difference. As we do, we will also continue to comply with Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions “on the basis of race.”\n\nThese ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate. The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community. Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities hold for our country and our world.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M.

    "content": "Harvard on Monday rejected demands from the Trump administration that threaten $9 billion in research funding, arguing that the changes pushed by the government exceed its lawful authority and infringe on both the University’s independence and its constitutional rights.\n\n“The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a message to the community. He added: “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”\n\nGarber’s message was a response to a letter sent late Friday by the Trump administration outlining demands that Harvard would have to satisfy to maintain its funding relationship with the federal government. These demands include “audits” of academic programs and departments, along with the viewpoints of students, faculty, and staff, and changes to the University’s governance structure and hiring practices.\n\nThe $9 billion under review by the government includes $256 million in research support for Harvard plus $8.7 billion in future commitments to the University and several renowned hospitals, among them Mass General, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Boston Children’s. Late Monday, the Trump administration announced that it was moving to freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard.\n\nThe Trump administration has been critical of Harvard’s handling of student protests related to the Gaza war. It has accused the University of failing to adequately protect Jewish students on campus from antisemitic discrimination and harassment, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nGarber emphasized that Harvard remains committed to fighting antisemitism, including through a series of campus measures implemented over the past 15 months. In addition, he said, the University has complied with the Supreme Court decision that ended race-conscious admissions and has worked to broaden intellectual and viewpoint diversity at Harvard.\n\nThe University’s objectives in fighting antisemitism will “not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate,” Garber said. “The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community.”\n\nHarvard is just one of dozens of schools targeted by the Trump administration in recent weeks. Last month, the Department of Education sent letters to 60 universities, including Columbia, Northwestern, the University of Michigan, and Tufts, threatening enforcement actions for noncompliance with anti-discrimination provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The administration has taken the additional step of freezing research funding at several institutions.\n\nRobust research and innovation partnerships among universities, the federal government, and private industry date to World War II. Government-backed research conducted at schools across the nation has led to countless discoveries, devices, treatments, and other advances that have helped shape the modern world. Computers, robotics, artificial intelligence, vaccines, and treatments for devastating diseases have all stemmed from government-financed research that crosses from labs and libraries into industry, creating new products, companies, and jobs.\n\nIn March, a report from the nonprofit United for Medical Research showed that every dollar of research funded by the National Institutes of Health — the nation’s largest funder of biomedical research — generates $2.56 in economic activity. In 2024 alone, the NIH awarded $36.9 billion in research grants, generating $94.5 billion in economic activity and supporting 408,000 jobs, according to the report.\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Daniel P. Gross, an associate professor of business administration at Duke University and co-author of a recent NBER working paper on the decades-long partnership between the U.S. government and higher ed, said the withdrawal of research funding from universities would be “catastrophic” to American innovation.\n\n“Universities are such an integral part of the modern U.S. innovation system that it wouldn’t stand without them,” said Gross, who taught at Harvard Business School before moving to Duke.\n\nGeorge Q. Daley, dean of Harvard Medical School, said that biomedicine has long depended on a strong partnership with the federal government, one that has paid off for Americans in life-saving advances. Just this month, he noted, the Medical School’s Joel Habener was recognized with a Breakthrough Prize for his work on GLP-1, which has led to diabetes and anti-obesity drugs. Daley also cited transformative work in cardiovascular health, cancer immunotherapy, and a host of other conditions.\n\n“As we look back over the 70 years of that partnership, it has returned brilliantly on the investments the government has made,” he said. “The fact that we have Harvard, MIT, and all these extraordinary hospitals, that has been a magnet for venture capital investment and now we have the pharmaceutical research infrastructure being brought into our community. All of this is a jewel in the crown of American bioscience.”\n\nThe threat to that science is an even bigger issue in an era of stepped-up competition with China, he added.\n\n“It seems self-defeating and injurious to the economy and to U.S. leadership in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals,” Daley said. “It feels like the hammer has come down in a way that threatens something that is intrinsic to U.S. leadership and ultimately to our economic competitiveness with places like China, which are investing very, very heavily in biotechnology.”\n\nIn his message to the community, Garber stressed the contributions of university research to scientific and medical progress while underlining the importance of independent thought and scholarship.\n\n“Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere,” he said. “All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom.”",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\nEarlier today, the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism issued a letter putting at risk almost $9 billion in support of research at Harvard and other institutions, including hospitals in our community. If this funding is stopped, it will halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.\n\nThe government has informed us that they are considering this action because they are concerned that the University has not fulfilled its obligations to curb and combat antisemitic harassment. We fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry. Urgent action and deep resolve are needed to address this serious problem that is growing across America and around the world. It is present on our campus. I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university.\n\nFor the past fifteen months, we have devoted considerable effort to addressing antisemitism. We have strengthened our rules and our approach to disciplining those who violate them. We have enhanced training and education on antisemitism across our campus and introduced measures to support our Jewish community and ensure student safety and security. We have launched programs to promote civil dialogue and respectful disagreement inside and outside the classroom. We have adopted many other reforms, and we will continue to combat antisemitism and to foster a campus culture that includes and supports every member of our community.\n\nWe still have much work to do. We will engage with members of the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism to ensure that they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions we will take going forward to combat antisemitism. We resolve to take the measures that will move Harvard and its vital mission forward while protecting our community and its academic freedom. By doing so, we combat bias and intolerance as we create the conditions that foster the excellence in teaching and research that is at the core of our mission.\n\nMuch is at stake here. In longstanding partnership with the federal government, we have launched and nurtured pathbreaking research that has made countless people healthier and safer, more curious and more knowledgeable, improving their lives, their communities, and our world. But we are not perfect. Antisemitism is a critical problem that we must and will continue to address. As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive. Our commitment to these ends—and to the teaching and research at the heart of our University—will not waver.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber",

    "content": "Harvard Magazine has long published commentaries from the president on matters that are timely and relevant to the life of the University. In an era of rapid news cycles, it can be challenging to craft copy that made sense given the long lead times for the magazine’s bimonthly production schedule. We are pleased, therefore, to resume such essays from President Alan M. Garber as his schedule permits, for rapid publication online.\n\n—The Editors\n\nMuch has changed since I arrived on campus as an undergraduate in 1973. In recent years, as provost and now as president, I’ve been able to play a role in some of those changes, which were possible because, as a community, we have resisted the easy comfort of a sense of complacency. Pushing the boundaries of our mission into new and exciting areas of promise—especially broadening access to a Harvard education—is what we’re about.\n\nMany would-be students are deterred by the fear that they won’t be able to afford a Harvard education. That is why we devote considerable resources to financial aid—more than $749 million across the University last year, one-third of it for the support of students in Harvard College. Our expanded undergraduate financial aid program, announced last week and going into effect this fall, will pay for tuition, housing, food, and other expenses for students from families with incomes of $100,000 or less. Harvard will be tuition-free for students from families with incomes of $200,000 or less. When we bring down the financial barriers to a Harvard education, a goal nearly as old as the University itself, we attract students with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, enriching the residential learning environment for everyone.\n\nAs we support students who pursue degree programs on our campus, we also continue to reach learners around the world. By the time edX, our joint online learning platform with MIT, was acquired nine years after its launch, we had reached 39 million individuals through more than 2,800 courses offered by our two institutions and nearly 200 partner universities. Our experience not only revealed unexpected ways in which the real and the virtual complement one another, it also instilled in us a deeper appreciation for the work that is still to be done. We are approaching much of that work through Axim Collaborative, a non-profit Harvard and MIT created with proceeds from the sale of edX. Its purpose is to expand access to education and meet the needs of underserved students. Axim is developing and funding partnerships with broad access institutions such as community colleges, as well as technology innovators and research organizations, to enable success, encourage persistence, and create career options after postsecondary study. This effort, still in its early days, promises a future in which millions of learners have the opportunity to fulfill their potential regardless of their personal circumstances.\n\nAs our 400th anniversary draws near, we are reminded that one does not need to enter the Yard through Dexter Gate or even visit our physical campus to benefit from Harvard teaching and grow in wisdom. We will continue to remove impediments to access and create new avenues to achievement, guided by our commitment to excellence in the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge. There is, as always, much for us to learn, much for us to gain, and much for us to contribute to education on our campus and far beyond it. I am eager to continue advancing on this important front.",

    "content": "Harvard University President Alan M. Garber and Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Hopi Hoekstra on Monday announced that Harvard College will be free for students from families with annual incomes of $100,000 or less and tuition-free for students from families with annual incomes of $200,000 or less. This significant expansion of financial aid, which begins in the 2025-26 academic year, will make Harvard affordable to more students than ever, especially from middle-income families.\n\n“Putting Harvard within financial reach for more individuals widens the array of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that all of our students encounter, fostering their intellectual and personal growth,” Garber said. “By bringing people of outstanding promise together to learn with and from one another, we truly realize the tremendous potential of the University.”\n\nThe expansion will enable approximately 86 percent of U.S. families to qualify for Harvard College’s financial aid, extending the University’s commitment to providing all undergrads the resources they need to enroll and graduate.\n\n“Harvard has long sought to open our doors to the most talented students, no matter their financial circumstances,” said Hoekstra. “This investment in financial aid aims to make a Harvard College education possible for every admitted student, so they can pursue their academic passions and positively impact our future.”\n\nStarting in the 2025-26 academic year, Harvard College will be free for students whose family income is $100,000 and below. This covers all billed expenses including tuition, food, housing, health insurance, and travel costs. Additionally, each of these students will receive a $2,000 start-up grant in their first year and a $2,000 launch grant during their junior year to help support the transition beyond Harvard.\n\nStudents with family incomes of $200,000 or less will receive free tuition and additional financial aid to cover billed expenses, depending on their financial circumstances. And many students with family incomes above $200,000 will also receive aid, depending on their circumstances. Harvard’s financial aid staff work personally and individually with students and families to match each family’s specific situation.\n\n“We know the most talented students come from different socioeconomic backgrounds and experiences, from every state and around the globe,” said William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard College’s dean of admissions and financial aid. “Our financial aid is critical to ensuring that these students know Harvard College is a place where they can be part of a vibrant learning community strengthened by their presence and participation.”\n\nThe expansion builds on more than two decades of investment in undergraduate financial aid at Harvard, beginning in 2004 with the launch of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which completely covered tuition, food, and housing costs for students from families with annual incomes of $40,000 or less. This threshold has increased four times since then — from $60,000 in 2006 to $85,000 in 2023.\n\nIn 2007, Harvard eliminated loans, providing all assistance in the form of grants. It also eliminated home equity in determining a family’s ability to pay for College.\n\nHarvard has awarded more than $3.6 billion in undergraduate financial aid since launching the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. Harvard College’s annual financial aid award budget is $275 million for academic year 2025-26. Fifty-five percent of undergraduates currently receive financial aid. Their families paid an average of $15,700 for the 2023-24 year.\n\n“Our team works closely with each student to ensure full inclusion in the Harvard experience,” said Griffin Director of Financial Aid Jake Kaufmann. “The financial aid program is designed so that Harvard students can study, train, research, create, and fully engage in the Harvard experience with minimal constraints.”",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nUniversities throughout the nation face substantial financial uncertainties driven by rapidly shifting federal policies. We write to update you on the steps Harvard is taking to support our vital mission of research, teaching, and learning.\n\nBeginning with the experience of the Great Recession and honed by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University has developed contingency planning tools as part of our financial stewardship. In recent months, we have worked closely with Schools and administrative units to prepare for changes in the revenues that support our mission. As part of Fiscal Year 2026 budget planning, which is under way, we have asked Schools and units to identify strategic adjustments in their spending to build the long-term capacity needed to advance academic priorities at a time of uncertain revenues. We are grateful to the faculty and staff at Schools and units across our campus who are working hard to make progress on this important undertaking.\n\nWe need to prepare for a wide range of financial circumstances, and strategic adjustments will take time to identify and implement. Consequently, it is imperative to limit significant new long-term commitments that would increase our financial exposure and make further adjustments more disruptive. Effective immediately, Harvard will implement a temporary pause on staff and faculty hiring across the University. In the coming days, we will work closely with the leadership of Harvard’s Schools and administrative units to help determine how to implement this guidance in extraordinary cases, such as positions essential to fulfilling the terms of gift- or grant-funded projects. We are also asking the leadership of Schools and administrative units to scrutinize discretionary and non-salary spending, reassess the scope and timing of capital renewal projects, and conduct a rigorous review of any new multi-year commitments.\n\nPlease keep in mind three important points: First, the hiring pause is temporary. It is meant to preserve our financial flexibility until we better understand how changes in federal policy will take shape and can assess the scale of their impact. We plan to leave the pause in effect for the current semester but will revisit that decision as circumstances warrant. Second, this temporary pause does not supplant broader efforts already under way across our campus to identify structural savings and capacity. Third, while we continue to plan for multiple scenarios in both the short and long term, rest assured that Harvard is working hard to advocate for higher education in our nation’s capital and beyond. Expanding access to higher education for all, preserving academic freedom, and supporting our community’s research, teaching, and learning will always be our highest priorities.\n\nWe are enormously grateful for your dedication and commitment as we work collectively to advance our mission. Though current uncertainties touch every corner of the University and of higher education, we are confident that we will be able to address the present challenges together as we continue to pursue academic excellence in service to the nation and the world.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M.

These projects, from groups with varied memberships and activities, share the goal of bringing people together and building mutual respect. I am eager to see how their work progresses over the spring term.

Yesterday, in my opening remarks at our annual Forum, focused this year on cultivating bonds and building bridges, I reaffirmed our longstanding commitment to spurring and speeding excellence by embracing difference in its many forms. Together, we will continue to build a community in which people of all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives come together to learn, grow, and thrive as we embrace the rights and responsibilities that membership in such a community demands.\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, some of you have asked me what you can do to support the University at a moment when so much seems uncertain. Encourage one another in your work; celebrate academic excellence; take nothing about our extraordinary institution for granted.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber",

    "content": "The strong, uninterrupted partnership among the federal government, research universities, and industry underpins America’s leadership in biomedical discovery and its application to human health. Federal funding for scientific research has helped make the United States a magnet for outstanding talent, a springboard for ambitious ideas, and a wellspring of rapid and accelerating progress, manifested in an ever-growing list of life-saving treatments for heart disease, cancer, and genetic diseases, along with technological innovations that have strengthened our economy. It is no wonder that the American model—refined and improved over nearly eighty years—is the envy of the world.\n\n\n\nOn Friday evening, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released new policy guidance that will weaken that position by deeply cutting an important but frequently misunderstood source of research funding in existing and emerging areas of promise. These circumstances are deeply concerning to many of us. Earlier today, Vice Provost for Research John Shaw outlined measures that the University is taking to monitor these developments and to provide guidance as available.\n\n\n\nEvery scientific and medical breakthrough, whether in basic or applied research, depends on the people who conduct the research, as well as the materials and laboratory equipment they use. These components of research, readily attributable to a specific project, are funded as direct costs, but they do not encompass all essential aspects of research. The work also requires laboratory facilities, heat and electricity, and people to administer the research and ensure that it is conducted securely and in accordance with federal regulations. The expenditures for these critical parts of the research enterprise are called indirect costs. They are substantial, and they are unavoidable, not least because it can be very expensive to build, maintain, and equip space to conduct research at the frontiers of knowledge.\n\n\n\nImplementing a 15 percent cap on indirect support, as the NIH has announced it intends to do, would slash funding and cut research activity at Harvard and nearly every research university in our nation. The discovery of new treatments would slow, opportunities to train the next generation of scientific leaders would shrink, and our nation’s science and engineering prowess would be severely compromised. At a time of rapid strides in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, brain science, biological imaging, and regenerative biology, and when other nations are expanding their investment in science, America should not drop knowingly and willingly from her lead position on the endless frontier.\n\n\n\nAlong with our fellow research universities and many others across higher education, industry, and the wider scientific community, Harvard will continue to advocate for a nation strengthened and enriched through its research efforts, a nation that wields knowledge in service of its people. Our institutions are as necessary for the health and prosperity of our country as they have ever been. With rapid advances in so many areas of the life sciences, breakthroughs are becoming more frequent and more consequential. Now is the time to defend the research partnership that has done so much for our nation and the world, and that can do even more in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\nAs we navigate a period of uncertainty for higher education, we are working with the deans and with other senior leaders from across the University to identify the ways in which emerging regulations and legislation, including yesterday’s memorandum issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), may affect our community and to address their implications.\n\nAccording to the most recent OMB guidance, the directive to pause federal funding will not apply to student financial aid, including federal student loans and Pell Grants. If you are a student, you should continue to register for and attend classes unimpeded.\n\nThe directive does require a pause on a subset of federally funded research activities implicated in an evolving set of executive orders or through stop work orders or other guidance issued by federal agencies. If you are a member of our research community, you should expect to receive additional direction later this afternoon if you have not already.\n\nIn these challenging times, our efforts will be guided by our values and commitments: supporting academic excellence and the pursuit of knowledge; championing open inquiry, constructive dialogue, and academic freedom; building a community in which people of all backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences come together to learn, grow, and thrive; and embracing the rights and responsibilities that membership in such a community demands. We will work together—and with you—to uphold these values and commitments, and to pursue excellence in our core mission of teaching, learning, and research.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M.

    "content": "Dear Cornell community,\n\nWe write in response to the May 2 National Science Foundation (NSF) announcement of significant across-the-board reductions in indirect costs for research funding to institutions of higher education under awards made on or after Monday, May 5. This NSF action is similar to the February announcement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the April announcement from the Department of Energy (DOE), except that the NSF cap does not apply to existing awards.\n\nIn each case, the proposed 15% indirect cost cap is far less than the agreed-upon rate negotiated by the government and the university. An NSF cut of this magnitude would imperil Cornell’s ability to support research discovery. When the NIH and DOE announced similar cuts to indirect costs, Cornell joined other universities and associations in legal action. We have been successful thus far in achieving federal court orders enjoining the implementation of those onerous caps. And yesterday evening, Cornell joined 12 other universities as a plaintiff in a lawsuit (PDF) filed by the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education challenging the new NSF policy.\n\nIndirect costs are an essential component of the decades-long partnership between the federal government and universities to conduct research that contributes to national security, advances innovation, fuels the economy, and saves lives. The government sets research priorities and invites researchers to submit proposals. Agencies award grants in a merit-based review process, selecting the researchers and institutions with the most promising proposals and awarding multi-year contracts. Indirect costs cover operating expenses only for competitively funded proposals, paying for facilities, utilities, libraries, financial administration, and safety programs that enable research to be responsibly conducted. Indirect costs are an essential part of this contract that the government enters into with universities. The rates for each institution are determined pursuant to federal regulations and the underlying costs are heavily scrutinized by the federal government as part of the approval process.\n\nWhat many may not know is that even at the full negotiated rate, Cornell must still use institutional funds to subsidize indirect costs to ensure the successful undertaking of federally-sponsored research. If the NSF’s established rate were to drop to 15%, the university would have to divert significant other funds to increase that level of subsidy to continue the research the federal government has selected us to perform. This would compound existing and looming financial challenges such as cuts to federal financial aid, stop-work orders, and grant terminations, and the potential imposition of an endowment tax.\n\nAs with other challenges, we must work together to confront this as a united community. Accepting lower indirect cost rates on future NSF awards would harm the university’s ambitious research enterprise. We must carefully evaluate this rapidly changing environment and make decisions so the university as a whole can continue “to do the greatest good.”\n\nWith thanks and appreciation,\n\nMichael I. Kotlikoff\n\nPresident\n\nKavita Bala\n\nProvost\n\nRobert A. Harrington\n\nProvost for Medical Affairs",

    "content": "Dear Cornellians,\n\nSlope Day is a cherished tradition at Cornell — a time for our community to come together to celebrate the end of classes. For decades, student leaders have taken the helm in organizing this event, hiring performers they hope will appeal to the student body.\n\nUnfortunately, although it was not the intention, the selection of Kehlani as this year’s headliner has injected division and discord into Slope Day. For that reason, I am rescinding Kehlani’s invitation and expect a new lineup for a great 2025 Slope Day to be announced shortly.\n\nIn the days since Kehlani was announced, I have heard grave concerns from our community that many are angry, hurt, and confused that Slope Day would feature a performer who has espoused antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media. While any artist has the right in our country to express hateful views, Slope Day is about uniting our community, not dividing it.\n\nI have spent the last few days talking privately with many students about Slope Day, and I appreciate the candor they shared. I also spoke with the student Slope Day Programming Board, who agree that this selection has compromised what is meant to be an inclusive event. Going forward, we will work together to revise the process for researching and selecting performers for this important annual event.\n\nI understand that my decision will be celebrated by some and criticized by others. I believe it is the right thing to do and the decision I must make to ensure community and safety at this high-profile event that reaches the entire campus. Cornell is an institution where “any person can find instruction in any study,” and where every person should feel included at the signature social event of the year.\n\nI look forward to celebrating Slope Day together with all of you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I.

    "content": "Dear Cornell community,\n\nRecent media reports have suggested that over $1 billion in federal funding to Cornell has been frozen—including grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and reductions by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These reports are troubling. To date, Cornell has received no official notice confirming these alleged cuts or any rationale behind them.\n\nWe are actively engaging with the Administration, federal agencies, and policymakers to clarify the situation, protect our research enterprise, and ensure that the facts are fully understood. University leaders across all campuses are tracking developments, assessing impact, and will keep our community informed.\n\nAs shared earlier, Cornell began receiving stop-work orders in February, including a major funding loss from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This month alone, we received more than 90 additional stop-work orders, primarily from the Department of Defense, affecting vital research at Ithaca, Cornell Tech, and Weill Cornell Medicine, ranging from military innovation to cancer treatment to infectious disease prevention.\n\nWe are responding forcefully. That includes legal, strategic, and policy-level engagement to reverse these actions and prevent further disruption. Last week, Cornell joined peer institutions in challenging the Department of Energy’s proposed 15% cap on indirect cost recovery. The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts issued a Temporary Restraining Order halting the cap while litigation proceeds, with a hearing scheduled for April 28. This follows our successful challenge to the NIH’s prior attempt to reduce indirect cost reimbursements.\n\nWe know many of you are asking: “What can we do?” The answer is: stay focused. Keep advancing Cornell’s mission. This university’s legacy—more than 150 years of public service through education, discovery, and care—is built on resilience, excellence, and impact.\n\nWe will meet this moment, defend what matters, and emerge stronger—united in our purpose “to do the greatest good.”\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I.

Research sponsored by the Department of Energy entails significant indirect expenses such as large-scale computing, lab maintenance, and safety requirements for hazardous and radioactive materials.\n\nCornell has long engaged in research sponsored by federal agencies, which rely on universities to undertake basic and applied scientific studies that are critical to the American economy and national security.\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) chooses universities like Cornell to take on critically important scientific exploration that adds immeasurably to our economy and scientific understanding, including discoveries that support manufacturing and industrial efforts vital to national security, American manufacturing, economic competitiveness, and progress toward energy independence. Projects cover a wide range of disciplines and applications, including revolutionizing the fundamental understanding of electroanalytical chemistry, developing materials for energy independence, designing circuits for artificial intelligence, maintaining safety and security of nuclear weapons, developing biodegradable plastic, and creating materials for stealth technology.\n\nArbitrarily cutting indirect costs will cause irreparable harm to Cornell’s research enterprise, paralyze progress on projects of national importance, and threaten the training of the next generation of energy scientists.\n\nCornell remains committed to its ambitious research mission and appreciates every opportunity to harness scientific inquiry for the public good. We are eager to have a thoughtful conversation about how we could partner with the federal government to reduce research operating costs while preserving the partnership that underlies the many benefits of sponsored research for the American people, economy, and global competitiveness.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I.

The policy is effective immediately and replaces the former Interim Expressive Activity Policy.\n\nOver many months, the 19-member Cornell Committee on Expressive Activity (CCEA), chaired by Colleen Barry, dean of the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy, developed and refined the policy based on feedback presented by campus stakeholders at listening sessions and shared governance meetings, hundreds of written comments, a thorough review of peer institution policies, and extensive committee deliberations. We are grateful to the Cornell community for its broad input and valuable perspectives in helping to craft a policy that upholds our institutional core values.\n\nSince Cornell’s founding, free and open inquiry and expression have underpinned our mission, and these ideals continue to guide us as we work to foster an environment where a diversity of ideas is welcomed and valued. At the same time, we recognize the need for expressive activities to adhere to time, place, and manner regulations that limit disruption to our community. We must also uphold our legal obligations to provide campuses free from harassment and discrimination. By balancing these principles in this new policy, we aim to support the rights of all Cornellians to exercise their freedom of expression while ensuring the safety and well-being of all faculty, staff, students, patients, and visitors.\n\nWe are grateful to Dean Barry and committee members for their dedication to this important work, and to the broader community for its thoughtful engagement throughout the process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the university will publish a webpage with additional resources to support implementation of this policy and to further educate our community on the value of expressive activity to our campus discourse.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I.

    "content": "The Pathways to Peace event Monday night provided an educational discussion on the complex history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and negotiations. Cornell successfully hosted a panel of esteemed former Middle East leaders and U.S. ambassadors who shared historical perspectives and unique insight for achieving a peaceful future. The hundreds of members of the Cornell community who came to Bailey Hall to listen, learn, and respectfully debate experienced an evening of information, introspection, and critical self-examination.\n\nUnfortunately, the event was marred by disappointing disruptions. The ability of speakers to present opinions and ideas, and to engage in thoughtful dialogue with the university community, is critical to the educational process and fundamental to university life. Individuals attempting to shout down speakers and disrupt dialogue seriously compromise our values. Those who disrupted the Pathways to Peace event were swiftly removed.\n\nCornell University Police identified 17 people responsible for this unacceptable disruption. Nine students will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for appropriate action, including the imposition of interim measures up to and including suspension. Staff members involved in the disruption will be referred for disciplinary actions through Human Resources. Outside disrupters will be issued persona non grata status, barring them from Cornell’s campus.\n\nAdditionally, for advertising and organizing this disruption, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), a student-run organization, faces suspension as a registered campus organization.\n\nEvents like Pathways to Peace represent our ambition to embrace diverse viewpoints and engage in difficult conversations. Cornell must be a place where all voices can be heard and none are silenced.\n\nMichael I. Kotlikoff\n\nInterim President, Cornell University",

    "content": "Dear Cornell community,\n\nToday the university is forming a new task force to examine critical questions concerning how and when Cornell should speak institutionally on matters of politics, ideology, current affairs, and world events.\n\nThe Task Force on Institutional Voice, led by Jens Ohlin, the Allan R. Tessler Dean of Cornell Law School, and Avery August, deputy provost and professor of immunology in the College of Veterinary Medicine, will define the university’s approach for responding to complex societal and global issues while also upholding our core value of free and open inquiry and expression.\n\nThe task force will work throughout the remainder of this semester to develop a framework for institutional speech that offers principles and best practices for university leadership and for colleges, departments, centers, and other campus units. Its final report will provide recommendations for when, how, and by whom institutional statements should be issued at various levels of the university.\n\nThis task force reflects our commitment to fostering an environment that supports and encourages open dialogue and freedom of expression by individual faculty, students, and staff while permitting space for Cornell to speak institutionally on fundamental issues that warrant response. Cornell’s founding principle of “… any person … any study” includes not only a diversity of educational experiences and opportunities, but also a diversity of views and expressions. The task force will keep this ethos at the center of its efforts.\n\nAs this work advances, the task force co-chairs welcome your insights and perspectives, which can be shared at tfiv@cornell.edu. Your input will be valuable in developing Cornell’s approach to exercising our institutional voice.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I. Kotlikoff\n\nInterim President\n\nKavita Bala\n\nProvost\n\nRobert A.

    "content": "Dear Cornellians,\n\nOver the past few weeks, many community members have expressed concerns about the rapidly changing environment of federal guidelines and regulations, including as they impact federal research programs, cuts to NIH funding, and, most recently, new guidance around diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in federally-funded schools and institutions.\n\nCornell leadership is working to evaluate this new landscape and its impact on our community, and we have established a university response planning team, led by the provost, to coordinate this work. This is a dynamic and evolving situation, and our response planning team will be prepared to address new developments as they arise. Today, I want to share the principles that are guiding our response.\n\nFirst, we reaffirm Cornell’s founding principle of opportunity and access: of being “an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.” In a time when most paths to higher education were closed to women, to non-Christians, and to people of color, Cornell’s founders were determined that Cornell would open its doors to all. This commitment to access, nondiscrimination, and free inquiry is core to who we are, and sets a standard that has helped make Cornell the model of the modern American research university: a powerhouse of innovation and economic impact that has enormously strengthened our democracy.\n\nSecond, Cornell prizes diversity as a driver of our excellence. A community rich in expertise and perspective, experience and background, is a more fertile environment for new ideas and insights, and it is essential to our mission. Our commitment to attract, welcome, and support outstanding students, faculty, and staff from every background is part of our founding ethos and core values, and that commitment will not change. Diversity comes in many dimensions, including viewpoint, life experience, and geographic diversity, along with diversity in socio-economic, first-generation college student, and veteran status. We interpret diversity in the broad terms of our “any person” history: we are stronger when all voices are included.\n\nThird, Cornell is committed to merit-based decisions in all of its processes. Just as we do not exclude anyone at Cornell for reasons irrelevant to merit, neither do we admit or evaluate students, hire or promote employees, award chairs or tenure, or make any other merit-driven decisions at Cornell based on race, ethnicity, or other attributes not relevant to merit.\n\nFinally: Cornell follows the law. To our understanding, none of the recent federal guidance limits the academic freedom of our community to research or study any subject, our ability to exercise free expression within a safe and respectful community, or our ability to adhere to the principles outlined above. We must be vigilant, particularly, to ensure that when Cornell departments, organizations, or interest groups offer programming designed to support particular groups within our community, those opportunities are equally open to all, without bias for or against any groups. We remain committed to ensuring equal opportunity for all of our students, faculty, and staff, without regard to race, gender, or any other characteristic protected by law. We will continue to convey this commitment to nondiscrimination in communications and our activities.\n\nWe will continue, as well, to work to ensure that our principles are consistently maintained, and to advance our mission in ways that comply with existing federal and state law.\n\nUpdated information on new executive orders, federal agency directives, and policy announcements affecting our mission of research, teaching, public engagement, and patient care, and our diverse academic community, will continue to be made available on our central website.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I. Kotlikoff\n\nInterim President",

    "content": "Dear Cornellians,\n\nToday, Cornell joined 11 other universities as a plaintiff in a lawsuit (PDF) filed by the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education challenging the cuts to indirect costs associated with National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants. We take this unprecedented step due to the unprecedented nature and enormous impact of this action by the NIH.\n\nFor decades, the NIH has partnered with universities to fund facilities and administration costs associated with federal research. This arrangement has greatly enhanced biomedical research, led to innumerable medical advances, and created a virtuous cycle of discovery, innovation, and entrepreneurship that is the envy of the world. Such sudden and dramatic cuts imperil this extraordinarily successful partnership. While we welcome a thoughtful process of evaluation of indirect costs, if the research capabilities of America’s universities are destabilized and undermined in this way, no institutions will be capable of filling the void of discovery and innovation as a public good.\n\nWe remain deeply committed to research that enhances the lives and livelihoods of people in New York state and around the world in tangible and lasting ways. We look forward to partnering with the NIH to ensure that we fulfill that mission together.\n\nA temporary restraining order issued today in a case filed by state Attorneys General means that Cornell will not immediately be affected by the NIH changes. Cornell and other university plaintiffs are proceeding with this lawsuit to ensure a long-term resolution.\n\nThank you for your ongoing dedication to research at Cornell and its broader impact. We will keep you informed of developments as we continue to navigate this challenge together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I. Kotlikoff\n\nInterim President\n\nKavita Bala\n\nProvost\n\nRobert A.

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nWe write today in response to yesterday’s NIH announcement of significant across-the-board reductions in indirect costs for research funding. Indirect costs cover essential expenses such as facilities, utilities, financial administration, and operations that enable research to flourish safely and responsibly. Indirect costs are an essential component of the decades-long partnership between the federal government and universities to conduct research that saves and improves lives and adds immeasurably to our economy. Federal cost sharing extends to many government agencies, and we are concerned that each of them may in turn be affected. These cuts violate this extraordinarily successful partnership and, if enacted, will irrevocably harm U.S. research and financially destabilize Cornell and universities across the nation.\n\nPlease know that Cornell is consulting peer institutions and legal experts to develop a coordinated response to this dramatic shift in funding academic research. We emphatically believe that cuts of this nature will irreparably harm American competitiveness and curtail the scientific breakthroughs that benefit society.\n\nLeadership across the university is working to assess potential impacts at the college and school, lab, and principal investigator level. We will share more specific data as it is available.\n\nWhile we work to reverse the announced reductions, we are engaging in thoughtful discussion with faculty and researchers with significant NIH portfolios. We encourage researchers to consider short-term measures for expenses and to avoid new hiring or spending for the moment. Please consult with your colleagues on shared resources and to think beyond the walls of your own labs to the people, activities, and equipment that might be shared to reduce our expenses.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, beyond this recent NIH announcement, we have received stoppages issued from other government agencies, including USAID. We at Cornell are working to understand, respond to, and mitigate the impact of these government actions. We encourage you to continue consulting the Executive Orders website for the latest updates, including research-specific updates and FAQs. If you have questions about existing grants or in-flight proposals, please email researchimpact@cornell.edu or WCMResearch@med.cornell.edu.\n\nCornell is a world-class research institution dedicated to discovery and translating that discovery to benefit the public in all aspects of American life. Our foundational mission “to do the greatest good” is unwavering. We will respond to this NIH news and other federal developments with decisions aligned with our academic commitment and institutional values.\n\nWith thanks and appreciation for all you do,\n\nMichael I.

Morgan Dean of the College of Human Ecology, and Marla Love, the Robert W. and Elizabeth C. Staley Dean of Students, is charged with gathering data, reviewing existing research, examining strategies employed at peer institutions, and consulting with the campus community and subject matter experts to make informed, actionable recommendations for reducing and preventing sexual assault at Cornell. They will take a holistic approach, looking at the issue from multiple angles — including academic, social, and residential life — and recommendations will be focused on prevention and the broader social context in which these incidents occur.\n\nThis summer, the task force will deliver a report that outlines evidence-based strategies for addressing sexual assault at Cornell, including a timeline for implementation, metrics for success, and a plan to institutionalize this work.\n\nThis task force represents our ongoing commitment to creating a campus culture where everyone can thrive in an environment of respect and safety. Sexual assault has no place at Cornell, and we will continue to take a comprehensive, public health-oriented approach to address it. Our Sexual Harassment and Assault – Response and Education (SHARE) website offers resources for support, education, reporting, and advocacy for those impacted by sexual assault. However, we recognize that while we have made significant progress, more must be done.\n\nThis is a community-wide effort, and your engagement is vital. We encourage everyone to participate in the upcoming opportunities to provide input and share ideas for improving the way we address sexual assault at Cornell. You can share questions and feedback with the task force at tfsa@cornell.edu.

    "content": "Dear Cornell Community,\n\nWe have heard from many of you concerned about how the new executive orders, federal agency directives, and policy announcements may affect your work and your studies, and what impact they will have on our research, teaching, and public engagement missions. Cornell is closely monitoring these rapid developments: Our senior leadership teams across all campuses, the Office of General Counsel, and our federal relations staff in Washington, D.C. are actively working to analyze and assess new guidance coming from the federal government.\n\nThis is a quickly evolving and uncertain situation with potentially widespread and serious impact on the university. As during the COVID-19 pandemic, when rapidly changing events affected many parts of our community, Cornell has established a planning team from across the university, which is meeting frequently to share information and guidance. The response planning team is evaluating all changes in federal policy that impact our community, our programs, and our operations. The team includes campus leaders with expertise in federal grants and sponsored research, health care delivery, student financial aid, international programs, and immigration status. This team will make recommendations for actions the university can take to ensure the continuation of our mission-driven work and provide specific guidance to the community.\n\nWe are keenly aware of the concerns and confusion caused today by the order to freeze federal expenditures relating to federal grants and other programs. However, this order was subsequently temporarily blocked today by a federal judge. Our best advice is to not interrupt ongoing programs by pausing research or grant spending on existing awards, absent specific instructions from federal agencies. It is vital that we continue this important work in partnership with our federal sponsors, unless otherwise directed.\n\nWe are also aware of the significant concerns felt by immigrant and undocumented members of our community. Please know that Cornell remains committed to continuing its support of all members of the university community, and we will comply with university policy and federal law regarding the protection of sensitive personal information.\n\nToday we established a new dedicated central email address that members of our community can use to pose questions and share examples of impacts of these and other new federal policies. Our response planning team will monitor this email account.\n\nWe are also launching a new central website, Information on Executive Orders. Beginning this week, this website will be populated with emerging guidance and resources to support our community.\n\nWhile we recognize that these extraordinary developments are unsettling, we have come together before to address challenges to our community, and we have no doubt that we will work together to ensure the continuity of our missions.\n\nThank you for continuing to work together to ensure that we maintain our efforts to “do the greatest good.”\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I.

    "content": "Dear Cornellians,\n\nFor the past several months, Cornell has engaged in productive contract negotiations with CGSU-UE, the union representing graduate students holding assistantship appointments at Cornell. As voted upon by graduate students last fall, Cornell Graduate Students United (CGSU) is a local chapter of UE, the nationwide United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America.\n\nThis week, our negotiating teams engaged on the key question of “union security.” CGSU-UE is demanding a “union shop” arrangement, under which union membership would be required, as a condition of employment, of all graduate student workers. In Wednesday’s negotiating session, Cornell made clear that it would not accept such an arrangement, which would be contrary to our university’s core values and would have grave consequences for many of our current and future graduate students. Unfortunately, union negotiators have chosen to respond to this considered position with hyperbolic rhetoric, likening the university and its bargaining team to union-busting fascists, racists, and Nazis. We would like to make clear to the entire community what is at stake here, and why the university has taken this position and is unwilling to agree to the union’s proposal as written.\n\nThe CGSU-UE has stated that a union shop is important to its membership and necessary to ensure the security of the union. We respectfully disagree on both counts.\n\nMany graduate students and faculty have shared their concerns about CGSU-UE activities and the impact of a union shop arrangement, and asked that Cornell not agree to a collective bargaining agreement that would effectively compel graduate student workers to choose between joining UE and leaving their degree program. While representing the rights of Cornell graduate student workers, CGSU-UE also represents, advances, and supports UE’s political action on a range of consequential domestic and international issues including, most recently, the U.S. election and U.S. military aid to Israel. Accepting a union shop provision would mean requiring every one of our graduate student workers to affiliate with, and financially support, this advocacy. Typically, union dues support both representational activities and political advocacy.\n\nCornell’s proposal allows graduate students to make their own decision. For those students who elect to become members of the union, Cornell has offered to promptly carry out union dues deductions from graduate student workers’ stipends, beginning with the first full pay period following receipt of the student’s written authorization. This would facilitate the union’s ability to collect dues for those students who wish to authorize this deduction from their stipends on their behalf. Students who chose not to become members of the union would not be required to do so.\n\nWe want to be clear that Cornell is not opposing unionization of graduate student workers, and we are open to considering proposals other than the union shop that has been proposed. However, if the university were to agree to the union shop stipulation the CGSU-UE is now demanding, students who decline to join the union could be dismissed from their appointments and prohibited from holding future appointments. These students would no longer have a viable path to a degree at Cornell. Under the proposed union shop agreement, there is no option for students to remain graduate assistants if they object to joining the union. This would be deeply unfair to our students, incompatible with our commitment to academic freedom, and detrimental to our future ability to attract the most promising students to Cornell.\n\nWe look forward to continued productive conversations at the bargaining table and a contract in the best interests of all graduate students.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael I. Kotlikoff\n\nInterim President\n\nKavita Bala\n\nProvost",

    "content": "Eight years ago, in 2017, I began writing annual “State of the University” letters to provide updates about Princeton’s progress toward strategic goals along with my reflections on major issues relevant to higher education. The first of those letters summarized priorities from the strategic framework adopted by the Board of Trustees in 2016, and the second described key features of the campus plan that was published in late 2017.\n\nIn this year’s letter, I describe some of the extraordinary projects envisioned by that strategy and campus plan that have opened already or are opening soon. I also reflect on national conversations in which Princeton has an opportunity and obligation to lead, including discussions about the role of charitable higher education endowments and our ongoing commitment to attract talented people from all sectors of society and enable them to thrive at this University.\n\nMy comments do not address the multiple executive orders and other federal directives issued over the last ten days. As I noted in my brief message to the campus yesterday, I appreciate that members of our community have many questions and concerns about those orders. As I also said, there is much that we do not yet know about their implications. My colleagues and I are examining the orders and exploring what steps we can take that are sensitive to the needs of our community, consistent across the University, and in compliance with applicable laws. We will be in touch when we have more information to share.\n\nFrom “Coming Soon” to “Now Open”: 18 Months of Ribbon Cuttings\n\nAs Princeton enters the final months of the Venture Forward alumni engagement and fundraising campaign, the projects described in my first two State of the University letters are now coming to life across the campus. We are in the midst of an 18-month period in which the University will open more than a dozen substantial new facilities and spaces that enhance the University’s mission.\n\nI especially look forward to cutting the ribbons on a collection of buildings pivotal to the University’s core teaching and research mission. One of them is our magnificent new art museum, which I expect will energize scholarly and educational projects in the humanities, social sciences, and other disciplines. The Princeton University Art Museum will at last have a building worthy of its outstanding collection—and that collection has received some dazzling and culturally significant additions while the construction project has been underway. The building will also provide a home for Princeton’s Department of Art and Archaeology and spectacular public spaces for lectures, classes, and other events that are essential to the scholarly life of our community. The grand opening celebration next fall will be a major campus event.\n\nOver a period of six months beginning this spring, facilities for the Omenn-Darling Bioengineering Institute, the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, the High Meadows Environmental Institute, the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and the Department of Geosciences will open along with a new Commons (a shared space that will support multiple departments) on Ivy Lane north of Princeton Stadium. These state-of-the-art science and engineering buildings will enable Princeton researchers and students to address some of the most intellectually compelling and urgently important issues of our time.\n\nSeveral projects advance the University’s commitment to support and promote the mental and physical well-being of its students, staff, and faculty. These include the spacious Frist Health Center that opened in January; the immediately popular Class of 1986 Fitness and Wellness Center attached to Dillon Gymnasium that opened last semester; and the recently unveiled Wilkinson Fitness Center, also accessible to the entire University community, which is located within the Racquet and Recreation Fieldhouse on the Meadows Campus across Lake Carnegie.\n\nIf you’ve not done so already, I hope that you will find time to visit all these facilities. The Frist Health Center provides a new and better home for University Health Services. It also offers beautiful spaces for programs and events that we hope will encourage students, faculty, and staff to make wellness central to their lives. I expect that the center’s warm, welcoming design will make people eager to spend time there—not something most would say about the old McCosh!\n\nThe fieldhouse and the Wilkinson Fitness Center contained within it are among several projects that have activated the Meadows Neighborhood and made it integral to Princeton’s campus and mission. The largest of those projects, the Meadows Graduate Housing complex, opened last spring. It enabled Princeton to offer housing to more fully enrolled graduate students than ever before, advancing a major long-term priority of both the University and the Graduate Student Government. Haaga House, the headquarters for Princeton’s rugby programs, opened in the Meadows Neighborhood this fall, and the softball team will play its first season at Cynthia Lynn Paul ’94 Field this spring.\n\nMajor landscaping projects have also revitalized portions of the campus. For example, the reopened Poe and Pardee Fields emerged as a joy-filled focal point of outdoor activity on campus last fall. Underneath the gracious lawns and expansive playing fields are geo-exchange bores that will help Princeton achieve its carbon-neutrality goals and make the campus more sustainable for decades to come.\n\nThe overall scope of the transformation is remarkable. In late 2017, we published what we described as a 10-year campus plan within a 30-year window: we sought to identify options and principles to guide decision-making over the subsequent 10 years while preserving flexibility and capacity that the University would require over the next 30 years. When the projects currently under construction or in design are complete, the total square footage constructed or renovated will be in the mid-range of what was projected for the entire 30-year period. For that reason, and because the current plan’s 10-year period concludes in 2026, we are initiating the process to update that plan. As was the case with our current campus plan, all community members will have opportunities to participate in the process.\n\nInvesting in People—Including Another Sector-Leading Record for Student Financial Aid\n\nThe improvements to the physical campus are especially visible, but people are the heart of this University. I am therefore especially proud of our initiatives to ensure that talented faculty, students, and staff from all backgrounds can thrive at Princeton. As part of those efforts, we have continued to increase the socioeconomic diversity of our undergraduate and graduate student bodies.\n\nLast year, the trustees of the University announced that Princeton would aim to have at least 70% of the undergraduate student body on financial aid. That was an ambitious goal, significantly higher than what Princeton (or, as far as I know, any of its peers) had ever achieved. It represented a commitment to increase the representation of middle-class and low-income families in Princeton’s student body.\n\nIn this year’s entering class, more than 71% of students are receiving financial aid and more than 21% are eligible for federal Pell grants, which go to students from lower-income families. We also matriculated 36 transfer students this fall, the largest cohort since we reinstated Princeton’s transfer program in 2018. The entering students include 26 community college transfers and 23 military veterans. (Some students are in both categories.) Our transfer students bring exceptional talent to Princeton and diversify the range of experiences and perspectives on campus.[1]\n\nAt the same time, Princeton is forging new connections with extraordinary people around us. In December 2023, the University announced a partnership with Governor Phil Murphy and the state of New Jersey to launch the NJ AI Hub. The NJ AI Summit, held on campus last April, drew more than 600 academic, business, and government leaders from throughout the state and beyond. We are poised to announce major new milestones for the Hub in the days ahead. This initiative, along with the world-class research taking place under the auspices of the Princeton AI Lab and throughout the University, will simultaneously enhance Princeton’s ties to the region around it and help to reinforce American leadership in critical AI-related technologies.\n\nOther exciting projects are on the horizon. Hobson College is rising across Elm Drive from Whitman College, with its opening anticipated in 2027. When the environmental science departments vacate Guyot Hall, it will be renovated and expanded to become Eric and Wendy Schmidt Hall—a much-needed state-of-the-art new home for Princeton’s Department of Computer Science and related units. A facility to house a new quantum science and engineering institute is in the advanced stages of design, and additional projects will follow.\n\nThese many enhancements to the University reflect the tremendous generosity of Princeton’s alumni and friends. They have rallied to support Venture Forward, a mission-driven campaign defined by the University’s strategic priorities rather than by dollar goals. Venture Forward launched publicly in October 2021 after a multiyear quiet phase. When it concludes this summer, Venture Forward will be one of the most successful campaigns in Princeton history in terms of dollars raised, alumni engaged, and, most importantly, beneficial impact on the University’s mission of teaching, research, and service.\n\nCharitable Endowments and Legislative Headwinds in Washington, D.C.\n\nPrinceton’s ability to seize new opportunities, and the excellence of its existing scholarly and teaching enterprise, also depend critically on the University’s endowment. The existing endowment leverages additional gifts that we receive through Venture Forward, enabling Princeton to attract and support outstanding faculty members, move boldly into new areas of scholarship and research, and make its undergraduate and graduate programs affordable for every student we admit.\n\nI want to say a bit more about the endowment because it is crucial to understanding the University’s budgetary outlook and because it is now the subject of worrisome taxation proposals that result partly from misunderstandings of what endowments do.\n\nEven sympathetic Princetonians sometimes ask why the University must continue to raise money when its endowment is so large. (At the end of the last fiscal year, in June 2024, the endowment’s value was $34.1 billion, down from a high of $37.7 billion in 2021.) People who raise this question sometimes assume that an endowment is like a savings account and that universities can “dip into it” to pay for unexpected needs or special projects, such as the COVID testing laboratory that we established during the pandemic, a new quantum science facility, or a dormitory renovation.\n\nAn endowment is nothing like a savings account. It is more like a retirement annuity that must provide income every year for the remainder of the owner’s life. At a university, endowment pay out must cover a portion of the operating budget every year for the rest of the university’s existence—and we hope Princeton will live for centuries.\n\nPrinceton’s endowment pays out more than 5% of its value each year. (The pay-out rate for the current fiscal year is 5.4%.) Those transfers account for more than two-thirds of the University’s annual operating revenue each year. They undergird every aspect of the University’s operations: faculty and staff salaries, financial aid, graduate stipends, building maintenance, athletics, libraries, laboratories, computational infrastructure, alumni relations—everything.\n\nThat is why neither our University nor others can simply “dip into the endowment” to pay for new initiatives. Universities are already spending from their endowments every year to pay for existing operations; indeed, the gifts that create endowed funds almost always stipulate that they must be drawn down every year to support scholarships, professorships, or some other designated purpose. Our financial model requires skillful endowment management along with a resolute commitment to trim unnecessary budgetary costs. To state the obvious: absent additional fundraising and investment income, if we expend an amount equal to 5% (or more) of today’s endowment value year after year into the future, then the entire University endowment, no matter how large, will be gone in 20 years or less.\n\nThanks to a combination of wise stewardship, donor generosity, fiscal responsibility, and favorable economic circumstances, Princeton’s endowment has grown substantially over the last several decades. For example, when I graduated from Princeton in 1983, tuition revenue and endowment pay out accounted for roughly equal shares of the University’s operating revenue. The transition to an endowment-driven revenue model over the past four decades has transformed every aspect of Princeton, making a great university even better.\n\nThe most obvious changes relate to undergraduate financial aid. Princeton made national headlines in 2001 when it became the first university to replace loans with scholarships so that students could graduate debt-free. At the time, only 41 percent of students were on financial aid—as opposed to 71% in this year’s entering class.\n\nThe average scholarship grant for students in the Class of 2028 is $73,000, which exceeds Princeton’s tuition price by more than $10,000. (Some aid packages cover all or part of room and board in addition to tuition.) Nobody is required to take out a loan to attend, and about 89% of students graduate debt-free. That is the endowment and Venture Forward at work: neither Princeton nor any other university could make its education so affordable if its budget depended heavily on tuition revenue.\n\nPrinceton also aggressively improved its support for graduate students when it announced its historic reforms to financial aid in 2001. The University substantially increased stipends, summer support, and healthcare benefits, thereby transforming the financial foundations for graduate education at Princeton.\n\nIn 2022, Princeton announced an average 25% increase to graduate stipends in all fields, and in September of that year we revealed another round of major improvements to the University’s undergraduate financial aid program. These endowment-supported enhancements to graduate student stipends and undergraduate scholarships were comparable in size and budgetary impact to the trailblazing changes that created the no-loan program in 2001.\n\nThe endowment’s growth, together with fundraising, also permitted the University to make bold investments in faculty salaries, which lagged behind inflation badly during the 1970s and 1980s. It enabled the University to supplement funding from the federal government and other outside sponsors to meet the rising cost of research programs capable of producing scientific breakthroughs, addressing urgent societal needs, and enhancing American prosperity and security. It allowed Princeton to fortify its budget for repair and improvement of the University’s buildings and grounds so that it could properly maintain the campus that its students, faculty, staff, and alumni so cherish.\n\nThe University’s endowment-driven budget model also means that our financial planning must be sensitive to changes in the endowment’s performance and prospects. The anomalous 46.9% return achieved in fiscal year 2021, when the economy rebounded from the pandemic, has now been offset by two years of investment losses and a return below 4% last year. (As a reminder, our budget model presupposes that the endowment will pay out around 5% on average even in years where investment returns are negative.)\n\nThe swings during this four-year period were extreme, but our financial planning anticipates significant volatility. Princeton’s endowment and budgetary models focus on the long term, and we assume that markets will have weaker years as well as stronger ones. It is not surprising that the massive gain in 2021, which in effect pulled forward earnings that would otherwise have been booked in later years, would be followed by a series of more muted returns.\n\nWe cannot, however, assume that long-term returns will be as robust as those that university endowments have seen over the past two decades, when Princeton’s returns averaged 9.9%. Indeed, the long-term returns of endowments have trended slowly but steadily downward for the past three decades as more institutions have competed for the best investments. The investment opportunities of the coming years will inevitably differ from those of the past, and there will be an even larger variety of organizations pursuing them.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, Princeton’s financial condition remains strong. Our resources permit us to sustain the excellence of our existing programs and to pursue new scholarly fields and projects. To do so, however, we will have to be clear-eyed about our priorities, we will have to trim unnecessary costs and be efficient in our management of resources, and we will have to continue to raise funds for initiatives that matter to the University, the country, and the broader world.\n\nWe will also have to continue to explain the University’s mission and operation to the Princeton community, lawmakers in Washington, and the American public. As I observed earlier, few people understand how endowments work and the public benefits they create. Misunderstandings about university endowments may have been one factor that led to the unprecedented creation of a federal tax on them in 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposed a 1.4% tax on endowment investment earnings. It thereby breached a long-standing and beneficial American tradition that exempted from taxation the earnings on charitable endowments, consistent with the philosophy that in this country we don’t tax nonprofit schools, hospitals, churches, and other purely charitable enterprises.\n\nThere is now discussion about increasing the tax, and some proposals would raise it substantially. I am devoting larger amounts of time to Washington, and I am working with colleges, universities, and other allies to explain to members of Congress and other policymakers why a larger endowment tax would damage higher education and our country. Endowments at America’s leading research universities support world-leading teaching and research programs that strengthen the nation’s economy and enhance its security. If endowments are routinely subject to threats of confiscatory or punitive taxation, it’s much harder to make long-term commitments that depend on annual endowment spending, such as expanding financial aid or investing in emerging areas of science that are critical to the nation.\n\nThe case against the endowment tax depends on three simple propositions, and I hope that you will join me in making the case on behalf of Princeton and other colleges and universities. First, colleges and universities put endowments to use every day, spending at rates that usually approach or exceed 5 percent. Second, that spending is essential to make education affordable and to pay for high-quality research and scholarship. Third, affordable education and world-class research benefit America by bolstering the country’s economy and making our nation more secure.\n\nRestrained Institutional Speech—But Not Silence—and Expanded Transparency\n\nWhen I go to Washington, I not only speak about the endowment but also invite questions from legislators about Princeton and other universities. Many have questions about topics such as free speech, antisemitism, and political bias. I am proud of the campus climate at Princeton, and I believe strongly in the value and quality of American colleges and universities more generally. I welcome the opportunity to talk about them.\n\nRarely, if ever, has it been so important for university presidents to speak up for higher education. It is also, of course, an unusually fraught time for university presidents to make statements. Critics pore over presidential messages looking for errors, bias, or other rhetorical sins.\n\nThere are many reasons why universities and their presidents should exercise restraint when speaking publicly. As I told our entering undergraduate students this fall, it is not the university president’s job to tell students, faculty members, or staff what to think about the issues of the day. On the contrary, my job is to ensure that people on this campus have the freedom to say what they think, and to encourage them to engage with, and learn from, one another.\n\nColleges and universities, moreover, depend upon support from the surrounding society. Our mission requires that we enjoy autonomy over academic decision-making and that we have the resources required to educate our students and pursue our scholarly mission. Americans’ willingness to grant these benefits depends on their confidence in the integrity of our truth-seeking mission and the quality of our teaching and research. That faith is put in jeopardy when universities or their leaders appear to act in ways that are partisan rather than scholarly.\n\nThese risks are heightened in today’s polarized political environment, in which Americans divide into opposing political camps that too often treat one another with suspicion and enmity. For that reason, as I also said when addressing our entering undergraduates in August, while I have issued statements only rarely in the past, I expect that I will do so even less frequently in the future.\n\nThe advent of new platforms for instantaneous communication—from mass e-mails to blogs to social media channels—has increased the opportunity and the demand for statements from academic leaders about current events. At Princeton, we have been parsimonious by comparison to many other universities about issuing statements and very careful about how we do it. Nevertheless, in today’s polarized political climate, it behooves us to be even more restrained in the future.\n\nI will accordingly try to avoid online posts or campus-wide e-mail messages about public affairs or world tragedies. Rare exceptions are inevitable: I doubt, for example, that any university president could avoid commenting after an event comparable to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.\n\nAt the same time, I will continue to speak up vigorously and often for the values of this University, including scholarly excellence, truth-seeking research, academic freedom, free speech, diversity and inclusion, and the importance of a liberal arts education that prepares students not only for their careers but for lives of service and citizenship. Where possible, I will use scholarly channels or long-form writing such as this annual letter, formal addresses, essays, or op-eds; where appropriate, the University may use social media channels to publicize these messages.\n\nThis policy of institutional restraint requires university leaders to make contestable judgments: to explain, defend, and uphold the values of their universities, presidents must occasionally comment on current events or make statements that some will deem political in character. In our divided and sometimes angry polity, criticism is inevitable.\n\nThe worst choice, however, would be to remain silent. University presidents—and, indeed, all of us who care about higher education—need to speak up for the value of teaching, research, and a college degree. We need to describe and defend the vital, vibrant activity taking place on our campuses. We need to explain why diversity and inclusivity are essential to the excellence of our campus communities and the achievement of our educational mission. We need to acknowledge our errors or shortcomings candidly and address them promptly, but we also need to push back against anecdotes and arguments that paint misleading pictures of our institutions and our aspirations.\n\nTo speak effectively, we will need not only to be forceful in our rhetoric but transparent about critical facts. I believe that higher education has a good story to tell, but we cannot expect that people will simply trust us. For that reason, Princeton was one of the first private universities to endorse the bipartisan College Transparency Act, which would provide families and the government with more data to judge the value of investments they might make in higher education institutions. The College Transparency Act applies to data such as enrollment, completion, and post-college earnings.\n\nSpotlight on Princeton’s Belonging and Inclusion Data\n\nI am proud of Princeton’s commitment to voluntarily disclose some climate data of another kind that universities rarely share. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Annual Report, also to be released this week, includes data each year about whether members of the graduating class would recommend Princeton to a high school senior with their “same background, ability, interests, and temperament.” We break down these data by race, ethnicity, and sex, among other categories.\n\nThis is sensitive material. It shows disparities in the student experience across demographic groups at Princeton. I expect that these disparities exist at most American universities, but I am not aware of any other universities that share their data publicly. Until recently, Princeton did not do so, either. University administrators quite reasonably worry that the data might be misinterpreted, or that—whether correctly interpreted or not—it might provoke complaints from campus groups, adverse comparisons with other institutions, or criticisms that target student groups by blaming them for their own dissatisfaction.\n\nThe risks are real, but the data inform the work that we and other universities do to enhance the inclusivity of our campuses. I am proud of the quality of the campus life that Princeton offers to all its students, but I want to see all our students thrive. The disparities in satisfaction levels show where we have opportunities to improve what we do.\n\nThe purpose of our diversity and inclusivity programs is to ensure that everyone has the support they require to benefit fully from the education that Princeton offers and feel that they belong fully to our community. We want all our students to feel—as I said in a previous letter, quoting President Bill Bowen’s comment about the Center for Jewish Life—that they are included on this campus as hosts, not just as guests. Princeton conceives of diversity broadly, and our inclusivity efforts address a wide variety of needs and groups: religious groups, different races and ethnicities, LGBTQIA+ students, military veterans, students with disabilities, and students who are from low-income families or first in their family to attend college, among others.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion programs have, however, become intensely controversial and heavily regulated. Too often debates about this topic are grounded in anecdotes or surveys of dubious value.\n\nWe have better data, and we need to share it. In the appendix to this letter, I include graphs showing data about undergraduate students’ satisfaction with their education, their willingness to recommend Princeton to others, their sense of belonging on campus, their sense that Princeton students treat one another respectfully, and their feeling about their ability to express their true opinions without being unfairly judged.\n\nThe data paint a complex picture of matters that are too often oversimplified. For example, politicians and journalists have expressed understandable concern about the experience of Jewish students on college campuses. I recognize that antisemitism is rising in this country and on college campuses; that is unacceptable, and we must respond vigorously.\n\nAt the same time, Princeton’s Jewish students report some of the highest levels of belonging of any group on the campus. That was true even during the protest-filled months of 2023-24. (These numbers are, of course, averages, and they must not erase the divergent experiences of individual students.) Other groups, including Muslim students, report lower levels of satisfaction. Both Jewish and Muslim students reported heightened concern last year about the possibility that they would be judged unfairly for expressing their opinions.\n\nAnother much-discussed topic pertains to viewpoint diversity on college campuses. I have accordingly included slides that disaggregate student responses on the basis of political self-identification. Once again, the data describe a complex landscape. For example, students who identify as “conservative” report rates of belonging comparable to those of more liberal students, but those who identify as “extremely conservative” report lower rates of belonging and higher rates of concern about whether they will be treated respectfully.\n\nThese data matter because we want all students to thrive at Princeton and feel that they belong here. We also believe that ours must be a community where all members can speak their mind and where they engage in civil and respectful dialogue, even on—indeed, especially on—difficult topics. We pay attention to survey results because they inform our ongoing commitment to support our students and improve their experience.\n\nNevertheless, as I noted earlier, the risks of disclosing these data are real. Some people may misinterpret the results or try to use them against us. Sometimes, moreover, the data will reveal genuine problems that we need to acknowledge and confront.\n\nAll of this will require hard conversations—but difficult discussions are essential to the defense of our mission and policies. They are also the core of what universities do: we insist that even the most sensitive topics be examined on the basis of facts and careful analysis.\n\nThis process of criticism and response, like the construction projects that I described earlier, is part of Princeton’s commitment to improve itself. President Bowen liked to say that Princeton is “always under construction.” His comment referred most literally to the bricks-and-mortar projects that were always underway somewhere on campus, but I have no doubt that his meaning was more general: it encompassed efforts to pursue new fields of research, forge connections to new partners, attract talent from all groups, and ensure that all faculty, staff, and students have the opportunity to thrive at Princeton.\n\nPrinceton is always under construction because, however good we are, we must aim to be better.\n\nI am grateful for your many contributions to that effort. I look forward to continuing our work together as we celebrate fresh beginnings and remarkable achievements, rise to meet difficult challenges, and energetically pursue this University’s mission of teaching, research, and service in the year ahead.\n\n[1] “Princeton welcomes Class of 2028, growing transfer student community,” https://www.princeton.edu/news/2024/09/04/princeton-welcomes-class-2028…",

The proposal includes capping indirect cost recovery at 15% for both new and existing NIH grants to universities, a significant departure from our current negotiated rate of 60% that would have profound implications for Northwestern’s research enterprise and for federally funded research across the country.\n\nWe recognize the urgency of this situation and are working internally and with peer institutions, advocacy organizations such as the Association of American Universities, the Association of American Medical Colleges, government leaders and other federal policy experts to understand and respond to this new circumstance. It is also likely these proposed changes from NIH will be tied up in litigation by various organizations.\n\nAs we anticipate potential serious financial impacts from this directive as well as other possible federal changes, we are evaluating various measures to protect the University, both now and in the future. We will share more in the coming days once those measures become solidified.\n\nIn the meantime, faculty who have specific questions about ongoing NIH grants should contact SponsoredResearch@northwestern.edu. You can find updates about this and other federal policy changes on Northwestern’s federal policy tracking page.\n\nThank you for your continued dedication to advancing research and innovation at Northwestern.

This afternoon, the White House rescinded the memorandum, but a White House spokesperson later tweeted that it was “NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze.”\n\nThe rapid and shifting sequence of events underscores the ongoing uncertainty around the recent Executive Orders and related agency actions as the country transitions to a new administration.\n\nAs directives and legal challenges play out, Northwestern’s leadership is reviewing the orders and their potential impacts on our community.\n\nClarifying guidance from OMB indicated that direct financial assistance to individuals such as Pell grants, student loans and veterans benefits are not affected. The full effects on federally funded research are less clear.\n\nWe recommend that absent a written stop-work order or other written notice from a federal agency, Northwestern faculty, staff, students and postdocs who are supported by federal funding move forward with their normal work activities. While Northwestern is not limiting expenditures at this time, we are awaiting further clarification from the federal government as to whether that will be necessary.\n\nWe are monitoring these issues carefully and will provide updates and additional resources as they become available. The University will launch a website soon to hold this information.\n\nPlease know that in addition to determining the best courses of action for Northwestern, we are actively advocating for our community, stressing the value of your contributions to our local communities and to society.\n\nThank you for all you do to make Northwestern a world-class university.",

Dr. King’s leadership during the Chicago Freedom Movement in 1966 brought the fight for civil rights to the Midwest, addressing critical issues such as housing discrimination and economic inequality — struggles that remain relevant today. His work in Chicago was a powerful testament to the importance of local activism in creating national change — a reminder that progress often begins within our own communities.\n\nIn this spirit, Northwestern’s MLK Commemoration events aim to carry forward his vision of justice and equity while celebrating the efforts and contributions of individuals and organizations from Chicago and surrounding communities. This year’s commemoration began Jan. 12 with the Candlelight Vigil hosted by the Alpha Mu Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., with an address from Northwestern alum Michael Blake ’04, New York City mayoral candidate and former New York state representative.\n\nThe Candlelight Vigil was followed by a Jan. 15 panel discussion featuring activist and artist Tonika Johnson and scholar Dr. Maria Krysan on their new book, “Don’t Go: Stories of Segregation and How to Disrupt It.” The discussion focused on the power of stories in shaping how we think about place, people and possibility.\n\nFollowing the holiday weekend, the 2025 MLK Commemoration keynote will take place at 5 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 21, in Galvin Hall. It will feature Shermann “Dilla” Thomas, Chicagoan, historian, cultural worker and creator of “You Don’t Know Chi!” on YouTube. Following his remarks, Thomas will join Medill senior lecturer and director of audio journalism programming Natalie Moore for a conversation about Dr. King’s legacy in Chicago and what it means for the ongoing fight for civil rights.\n\nFor keynote details and additional programming on the Evanston and Chicago campuses, please visit the Northwestern MLK website.\n\nWe extend our appreciation to the Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration planning committee and the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion for their dedication to curating opportunities that invite the Northwestern community to honor Dr. King’s legacy.\n\nAs members of the Northwestern community, we are uniquely positioned to contribute to the ongoing work of fostering equality, understanding and social change. By engaging with one another, supporting local initiatives and continuing the dialogue that Dr. King championed, we can ensure that his vision lives on through our collective actions. Each of us has a role to play in shaping a more inclusive and compassionate world. As Dr. King once said, “Life's most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’” May his words inspire us all to take meaningful action in the pursuit of justice, equity and a brighter future for our community and beyond.",

    "content": "Annual Financial Update for 2025\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nNorthwestern has entered the new year with strong momentum behind the research, teaching and creative work of our community. As our eminence grows around the world, we continue to pursue sustained excellence on our campuses, grounding our strategic decisions in the University priorities.\n\nAs we provide our annual financial update to the University community, we recognize that 2025 holds unknowns that may impact our financial operations. We are working proactively to prepare for various potential impacts and, if events dictate, we will provide updates to the University community.\n\nOpportunities and challenges\n\nWe are proud of Northwestern’s accomplishments and the exciting work that is underway to further enhance our institution’s ability to create and disseminate knowledge. While we are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead, we also must remain mindful of new and evolving financial pressures on Northwestern, our peer institutions and, indeed, all of higher education.\n\nAmong the most important ways we support our students is by addressing the rising cost of attendance through the price of tuition and the amount of financial aid we disperse. This commitment is a direct investment in a core component of Northwestern’s guiding principles and University priorities, and we are actively exploring ways to slow the rising cost of attendance and ensure Northwestern is accessible to the best and brightest students regardless of their financial means.\n\nThe constraints on tuition and the endowment payout, our two primary sources of unrestricted revenue, compel us to carefully examine how we allocate our resources for maximum impact. While we face these constraints on revenue growth, the University also continues to see expense pressures related to labor contracts, employee benefits, federal legislation, potential changes in federal policy, compliance, research administration, security and litigation. With these compounding pressures, we will ensure financial stability and our ability to continue to support strategic priorities by exploring opportunities for operational efficiencies, responsibly reviewing our expenditures and carefully examining how we allocate our resources.\n\nAs part of these efforts, the University is undertaking a review of our budget model and related processes to make us more nimble as we seize opportunities and respond to the shifting landscape of higher education. Goals of this initiative include greater financial transparency, better alignment of resource allocation with the University’s mission and priorities, and incentives for innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nPositive performance, assets and endowment\n\nNorthwestern ended Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 2024) with positive operating performance of $54.6 million, a 1.6% margin compared with our $3.3 billion in operating expenses. Positive operating performance is required to support investments in our capital priorities and infrastructure. Most of the FY 2024 positive performance is retained by schools and units for specific uses and future investments and is not available for general use.\n\nAnother key indicator of Northwestern’s financial health is its assets. FY 2024 net assets increased $690.5 million, to $15.6 billion, through philanthropy and growth of the endowment. It was the second-most-successful fundraising year in the University’s history, with support from generous donors providing funds essential to fulfilling our education and research mission.\n\nNorthwestern’s investments grew 4.5% and provided 23% of operating revenue, supporting our commitments to financial aid, faculty, academics and research initiatives across our campuses. A majority of the endowment is restricted for specific uses, and the endowment as a whole is a vitally important tool to ensure the future success and sustainability of the University.\n\nInvesting in our people and priorities\n\nNorthwestern allocated significant FY 2024 resources toward total compensation for faculty and staff through annual increases, faculty recruitment and retention pools, and incremental resources to support the rising costs of employee benefits. Additional funding provided increases for graduate student stipends and benefits. Meanwhile, the University continued its investments in financial aid for students, awarding scholarships and fellowships that exceeded $618.3 million. Twenty-two percent of the incoming Class of 2028 was Federal Pell-eligible. Reflecting the exceptional quality of Northwestern’s research, the University again achieved record-breaking sponsored research funding with $1.05 billion in awards, a 5% increase compared with the prior year.\n\nNorthwestern also advanced its priorities through capital investments, underwritten by generous philanthropy from alumni and friends of the University. Capital projects started during the fiscal year included the renovation of the Jacobs Center to create a hub for the social sciences and global studies and the redevelopment of student spaces and athletic facilities — including Cohen Lawn, the new Ryan Field and Northwestern Medicine Field at Martin Stadium. In addition, the Kellogg School of Management announced construction of a state-of-the-art, technology-enhanced facility for its Executive MBA and Executive Education programs, and Deering Library began a major renovation project.\n\nMaximizing future opportunities\n\nThrough careful planning, Northwestern has positioned itself to make targeted investments in our institutional priorities that strengthen the academic community and support our faculty, staff and students.\n\nAs we begin 2025, we are enthusiastic about what we can accomplish together in service of Northwestern’s mission.",

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\n\n\nFor the past several months, Columbia’s research enterprise has been confronting one of the most sustained and serious disruptions in its history. Major interruptions in federal funding, especially from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are affecting nearly every part of our research community. However, we are also responding with determination, urgency, and an unwavering commitment to what defines us as an institution.\n\n\n\nToday, I want to share how we are protecting Columbia’s research mission, both by addressing the immediate crisis and by planning for a more resilient, more strategic future.\n\n\n\nFederal Advocacy and the Future of Funding\n\n\n\nColumbia’s long and productive partnership with the federal government has made us a global leader in research. That relationship is now under strain. Approximately $400 million in federal grants have been terminated. Active projects are going unpaid, and some proposals are not being accepted for review.\n\n\n\nWe continue to engage with the federal government with the aim of restoring funding and reestablishing the flow of grant support in a manner that upholds and strengthens our institutional values. Through the Association of American Universities (AAU), we are also part of a coordinated national effort to push back on proposed cuts to NIH, National Science Foundation (NSF), and other agencies; reductions to facilities and administrative (F&A) reimbursements; and other policy changes that threaten the foundations of U.S. academic research. The AAU has launched a campaign aimed at educating the public on indirect costs, which is similar to the information we have posted about facilities and administrative costs at the University. These efforts are vital—not only to restoring funding, but also to reinforcing public trust in the research enterprise itself.\n\n\n\nStabilization and Support for Researchers\n\n\n\nTo support as much continuity as possible for our faculty, students, staff, and labs, we have launched two research stabilization funds:\n\nOne, created with the support of NewYork-Presbyterian, is focused on Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons and the clinical and translational research taking place there.\n\nThe other supports the broader university research community, with special attention to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows whose training grants have been affected.\n\nThese funds are not intended to replace federal support, but to serve as a bridge—allowing researchers to bring projects to completion, explore alternative funding, or pivot to new directions. The Office of the Executive Vice President for Research (EVPR) will oversee the application process, and more information is available on the EVPR website. Efforts to expand these funds through philanthropic support are already underway.\n\n\n\nLong-Term Resilience and Strategic Planning\n\n\n\nWe are also preparing for the long term. I have launched a Presidential Task Force on Columbia’s Research Mission together with our EVP of Research Jeannette Wing, chaired by Provost Angela Olinto and Acting CEO of CUIMC and Interim Dean of the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons James McKiernan (full membership listed below). The task force includes academic and research leaders from across the University and is charged with:\n\nStrategic planning and multi-year financial forecasting\n\nDeveloping sustainable alternative funding models\n\nAligning school-based efforts and sharing best practices\n\nRethinking our research footprint in the face of long-term shifts in the federal landscape\n\nThe task force will benefit from support from outside advisors and faculty experts at Columbia Business School.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we’ve created a Working Group on Strategic Engagement and Institutional Credibility (full membership listed below), which is developing new strategies for how Columbia can communicate its research values, mission, and public impact more effectively to a wide range of stakeholders.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear: We are committed to doing all we can to ensure that Columbia’s research enterprise not only survives this moment—but is positioned to thrive in the years to come. That commitment is not negotiable, and we will uphold it—through resourcefulness, partnership, and persistence.\n\n\n\nI am deeply grateful to all of you—faculty, students, postdocs, and staff—who continue to advance Columbia’s mission through your work, even under difficult and uncertain conditions. Your resilience is what makes Columbia strong. I will continue to listen, to engage, and to share updates as we navigate this moment together.\n\n\n\nWith appreciation,\n\n\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidential Task Force on Columbia’s Research Mission\n\nExecutive Sponsor: Claire Shipman, Acting President, Columbia University in the City of New York\n\nExecutive Sponsor: Jeannette Wing, Executive Vice President for Research; Professor of Computer Science\n\nCo-Chair: Angela V.

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\n\n\nEarlier today, a group of protesters occupied one of the main reading rooms in Butler library, refusing to leave, and another group breached the front door causing substantial chaos—all of this as the bulk of our students are working hard to prepare for exams. These actions not only represented a violation of University policies, but they also posed a serious risk to our students and campus safety. We had no choice but to ask for the assistance of the NYPD, and I’m grateful for their help and professionalism, as well as that of our Public Safety team. Let me be clear, what happened today, what I witnessed, was utterly unacceptable.\n\n\n\nI spent the late afternoon and evening at Butler Library, as events were unfolding, to understand the situation on the ground and to be able to make the best decisions possible. I arrived to see one of our Public Safety officers wheeled out on a gurney and another getting bandaged. As I left hours later, I walked through the reading room, one of the many jewels of Butler Library, and I saw it defaced and damaged in disturbing ways and with disturbing slogans. Violence and vandalism, hijacking a library—none of that has any place on our campus. These aren’t Columbia’s values.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear: Columbia unequivocally rejects antisemitism and all other forms of harassment and discrimination. And we certainly reject a group of students—and we don’t yet know whether there were outsiders involved—closing down a library in the middle of the week before finals and forcing 900 students out of their study spaces, many leaving belongings behind. Our commitment to a safe, inclusive, and respectful campus community is unshakeable, and we will continue to act decisively to uphold these values.\n\n\n\nLet me also make clear, our administration spent substantial time working to defuse the situation in multiple ways, through Public Safety and Delegate visits to the students, scenes I witnessed firsthand. The students were told they simply needed to identify themselves and then leave, but most refused. I worked with professors who generously came to have the same conversations. I am enormously grateful for the many people we have in our community, our Public Safety officers, our faculty, our staff, and my team, who work so hard to make Columbia what we know it can be and should be for our community. I also made sure to be present when the police arrived; I wanted to see for myself how the operation would unfold, and I’m grateful that it was orderly, professional, and extremely limited, with a focus on the students who refused to leave the reading room.\n\n\n\nI am particularly heartbroken, and incensed, that this disruption occurred when our students are intensely focused on critical academic work. At a moment when our community deserves calm and the opportunity to study, reflect, and complete the academic year successfully, these actions created unnecessary stress and danger. I have seen how much our community wants to take back our narrative, to do what they came to Columbia to do—learn, thrive, and grow—not take over a library. Moreover, I am deeply disturbed at the idea that, at a moment when our international community feels particularly vulnerable, a small group of students would choose to make our institution a target.\n\n\n\nWe, at Columbia, value freedom of speech, robust debate, and peaceful protest. Today’s disruption of Butler Library was not that. We must, and we will, come together as a community to consider what civil disobedience actually is and what it means. We need to recognize that when rules are violated, when a community is disrupted for the sake of a few, that is a considered choice—one with real consequences. There is a clear line between legitimate protest and actions that endanger others and disrupt the fundamental work of the University. Today that line was crossed, and I have confidence the disciplinary proceedings will reflect the severity of the actions.\n\n\n\nI am working with the Provost and University Life to ensure any affected students receive the support and resources they need. We have opened a new study space at Uris that will be available overnight for students.\n\n\n\nLet me also say this. I’ve received many messages from concerned parents. The group involved less than one percent of our 36,000-person student body. Their actions had a disproportionate impact.\n\n\n\nThis is the last kind of message I want to be delivering tonight. But Columbia’s strength lies in our resilience. We are strong, we are determined, and we will not let this moment define us. I have heard consistently from our community that we are ready to pull together, to fight for the value of Columbia. So, we will get back to business. Our real business. The business of teaching, learning, studying, and researching. We have an incredible Commencement to look forward to and finals to prepare for. We will move forward together to show the world the best of Columbia.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "I want to update the community on the latest information regarding the disruption at Butler Library. The individuals who disrupted activities in Butler Reading Room 301 still refuse to identify themselves and leave the building. Due to the number of individuals participating in the disruption inside and outside of the building, a large group of people attempting to force their way into Butler Library creating a safety hazard, and what we believe to be the significant presence of individuals not affiliated with the University, Columbia has taken the necessary step of requesting the presence of NYPD to assist in securing the building and the safety of our community.\n\nSadly, during the course of this disruption, two of our Columbia Public Safety Officers sustained injuries during a crowd surge when individuals attempted to force their way into the building and into Room 301. These actions are outrageous.\n\nIndividuals participating in the Reading Room 301 disruption were repeatedly asked for identification and to leave, and were repeatedly told that failure to comply would result in violations of our rules and policies and possible arrest for trespassing. We have been clear from the outset about applying our protocols and advising participants of the potential consequences of not complying. Requesting the presence of the NYPD is not the outcome we wanted, but it was absolutely necessary to secure the safety of our community.\n\nDisruptions to our academic activities will not be tolerated and are violations of our rules and policies; this is especially unacceptable while our students study and prepare for final exams. Columbia strongly condemns violence on our campus, antisemitism and all forms of hate and discrimination, some of which we witnessed today. We are resolute that calls for violence or harm have no place at our University. We will continue to keep our community apprised as the situation evolves.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\n\n\nIn March, the University shared its plan to assess and prioritize our research activity in light of substantial cuts to more than 300 multi-year awards for federally funded research. We write today to provide an update on the review process and share next steps as we continue to navigate how to best allocate resources amid significant fiscal pressures.\n\n\n\nAs many of you are aware, the University is engaged in a two-pronged effort related to grants terminated by the federal government. The first prong focuses on our continued efforts to restore our partnerships with government agencies that support critical research. Separately and in parallel, our Deans have carefully reviewed and prioritized our research activity to develop a plan for managing the affected research. We asked each principal investigator of a terminated award to develop a Research Action Plan (RAP) for review at the school level and to inform a school-based approach. During this review period, the University continued to fund those individuals whose salaries and stipends were previously funded with federal support on now-terminated awards.\n\n\n\nColumbia’s leadership continues discussions with the federal government in support of resuming activity on these research awards and additional other awards that have remained active, but unpaid. We are working on and planning for every eventuality, but the strain in the meantime, financially and on our research mission, is intense. Therefore, the second prong of our efforts is to take action to adjust—and in some cases reduce—expenditures based on current financial realities.\n\n\n\nMoving forward, we will be running lighter footprints of research infrastructure in some areas and, in others, maintaining a level of research continuity as we pursue alternate funding sources. In some cases, schools and departments are winding down activity but remain prepared to reestablish capabilities if support is restored. Across the research portfolio we have had to make difficult choices and unfortunately, today, nearly 180 of our colleagues who have been working, in whole or in part, on impacted federal grants, will receive notices of non-renewal or termination. This represents about 20% of the individuals who are funded in some manner by the terminated grants.\n\n\n\nWe do not make these decisions lightly. We are deeply committed, at Columbia, to the critical work of invention, innovation and discovery. The excellence of our research portfolio is fundamental to our identity, and we are determined to support it. Part of that support means recognizing a changing landscape. Increasing budget constraints combined with uncertainty related to future levels of federal funding for research, including proposed reductions in facilities and administration (i.e., indirect costs) reimbursements, requires us to make difficult choices. We have had to make deliberate, considered decisions about the allocation of our financial resources. Those decisions also impact our greatest resource, our people. We understand this news will be hard.\n\n\n\nAs schools and departments moved through the process of reviewing priorities related to terminated awards, it became clear that we need to be prepared to make additional investments to secure the strength of our research enterprise as we navigate future periods of uncertainty and change. Additional complexities and risks include the process and funding for obtaining new awards and continuations of existing research projects. To that end, the University has established a Research Stabilization Fund to navigate these future funding risks and lend support to our scientific community in multiple forms. These resources will be made available through an application process for internal grants to scientists to support their work for a limited time as they seek alternate sources of funding or complete the components of their research to enable publication of results. In addition, the University will contribute funds to schools over the next year to support our commitments to graduate students and post-doctoral fellows on terminated training grants, an area that has been severely impacted by terminations of federal support. The Stabilization Fund and Other Resources webpage developed by the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research provides more details about these funds and other resources on funding opportunities for the research community.\n\n\n\nFederal actions over the last several months and our perspective on the scale and scope of future funding challenges requires that we look across the University, not just to areas directly impacted by federally funded research, and continue to support Columbia as a national leader in higher education, pioneering research, outstanding patient care, and global societal impact. We will continue to make prudent budget decisions that will ensure long-term financial stability across the University, including making significant budget reductions within the University’s central administration. Across the University, we have set parameters to keep most salaries at their current level, without increases for the next fiscal year, with some schools and units providing a modest pool for employees at the lower end of their salary distribution. We have also developed programs to further streamline our workforce through attrition and are preparing to launch a voluntary retirement incentive program, the details of which will be shared next week.\n\n\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, we will need to continue to take actions that preserve our financial flexibility and allow us to invest in areas that drive us forward. This is a deeply challenging time across all higher education, and we are attempting to navigate through tremendous ambiguity with precision, which will be imperfect at times.\n\n\n\nWe are grateful for the exceptional leadership and professionalism of our deans, chairs, and senior management who have come together to navigate this critical moment with care and integrity, while upholding and advancing Columbia’s mission, values, and the unique qualities that make this a vital, extraordinary place. At the heart of everything we do is our unwavering commitment to the important work that Columbia has led for more than 270 years. As we continue to move forward, the compassion and teamwork of our community exemplify the best of Columbia.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York\n\n\n\nAngela V.

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\nThe end of the semester at Columbia is like a sprint to the finish line. Here’s what I heard from students enjoying our on-campus “Block Party” on Thursday: one paper needs just the right conclusion; the last problem set was just sent; the portfolio is almost ready for display; the group project gets one more run-through on Sunday; and we need another photo with Alma Mater. This year, the weather has been such an ally in highlighting the beauty of our campus in spring, offering vivid tableaux in every direction of the hurried and hopeful final days of the term.\n\nTents and bleachers are rising, and next week, students and faculty will be getting ready for finals, while our wonderful staff will be preparing the campus for my favorite moment—Commencement—where we will honor more than 16,000 new graduates and their families.\n\nThis has been a memorable—and tumultuous—year. But it’s also been typical in many ways, filled with moments like those above, and with countless extraordinary achievements and transformative experiences that have defined Columbia for generations.\n\nJust in the past few months, Columbia faculty have received Guggenheim Fellowships, been inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, been named honorary fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, won Sloan Research Fellowships, and been elected to both the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Inventors.\n\nWe can also mark a great year for Columbia’s student athletes, including our first Ivy League football title since 1961, a third-straight Ivy League championship for the women’s basketball team and their second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, an Ivy League title for our men’s tennis team, the selection of a Columbian as Ivy League Women's Tennis Player of the Year, and the men’s and women’s fencing teams finishing second in the nation at the 2025 NCAA Championships.\n\nOne thing that has been made clear to me, by faculty, staff, and students, is that we must take control of Columbia’s narrative, and start to better reflect to the world what we see and experience here. On this sunny Saturday, I hope we can all take pride in our remarkable accomplishments, and in the everyday yet meaningful experiences we all share here. There are so many more stories like these across the University, and I hope we can all begin to tell them.\n\nBest of luck on finals!\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\n\n\nIt’s been heartening, over the last week, to witness so many wonderful scenes on our campus: students everywhere in Commencement regalia, eager to capture photos in the balmy weather. Others dressed up, hurrying to senior dinner, posing along the way. The lawns consistently full of study sessions, friends hanging out, impromptu games, and the always-festive Night Carnival.\n\n\n\nBut I also spent much of the last week hearing from students, faculty, and staff, many of whom are experiencing deep unease and anxiety. They are either part of, or concerned about, our international community. Our campus has found a deep degree of unity on this point.\n\n\n\nLet me express a few things directly about the current situation and how we are offering support in ways we’ve been told are most valuable. I’m grateful for continued feedback:\n\nVisas: You may have seen reports this weekend that the federal government has restored many of the SEVIS records that had been canceled without explanation over the past several weeks. This is welcome news for Columbia’s international community. While we can’t predict future policy changes, please know we continue to be committed to ensuring that students who may be affected by disruptions in their visas will be able to continue their studies.\n\nAdvising: The International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) has significantly expanded its advising capacity. ISSO counselors are now available weekdays, 8:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m., and weekends, 9:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. Students may book appointments in advance for in-person or Zoom advising sessions, or you can always reach out by email at [email protected] .\n\nImmigration Webinars: These have been very well attended because of the deep expertise offered. The most recent ISSO webinar with immigration attorney Dan Berger took place today. There will be additional sessions scheduled in May. We encourage you to visit the new immigration website for additional information on Columbia’s programs and services.\n\nPort of Entry Challenges: We’ve heard repeatedly that a hotline would be useful, and we want to offer the following: International students, faculty, or researchers on a Columbia-sponsored visa who encounter issues at a U.S. Port of Entry should ask the Customs and Border Protection office to contact Columbia University Office of Public Safety at 212-854-5555, which will immediately alert the ISSO Director on call. Comprehensive information on what to expect at U.S. Ports of Entry can be found here for students and here for scholars.\n\nInternational Student Hardship Fund: International students who are facing unanticipated costs due to travel or visa issues, or the inability to travel home, are encouraged to request support through the International Student Hardship Fund. For more information on eligibility and the process to apply for support, please visit the Fund’s website.\n\nISSO Expansion: ISSO is currently adding staff to expand programming and support. In the coming weeks, we will announce additional professional and leadership development workshops, volunteering and networking events, social outings, and welcome programs for admitted students. You can stay up-to-date on these programs by following ISSO on Instagram (@columbiaisso) or visiting the ISSO website.\n\nUndergraduate Summer Housing: International undergraduate students in Columbia College and Columbia Engineering are encouraged to apply for summer housing on campus, if they have determined it’s a risk to go home for the summer. Additional housing stock has been made available. Priority will be given to students who are currently living in campus housing and have a permanent address in a country that has been identified as “restricted.” For more information, contact the Study & Family Support team at [email protected] . Continuing GS international students in Columbia Residential housing will continue to have access to summer housing under the terms of their existing housing contracts. GS international students who don’t currently live in Columbia Residential housing can apply for summer housing if they need support through the summer. For more information, contact GS housing at [email protected] .\n\nMental and Emotional Well-Being: It’s clear that for many students, the stress of these issues can have broader impacts on mental health. Columbia offers a wide array of support services; these services are confidential and available to all. For our Morningside/Manhattanville students in need of urgent mental health support, call 212-854-2878 (available 24/7) or access in-person drop-in. For CUIMC students in need of urgent mental health support, call 212-305-3400, after-hours press option 7, or access support via chat and phone through TELUS Health Student Support (available 24/7, within the U.S. and around the world). The full range of resources can be found here.\n\nCommencement: Graduating international students can pick up a Class of 2025 ISSO pin to wear to your Class Day ceremonies and this year’s Commencement ceremony at ISSO offices (Morningside or CUIMC) during business hours. In addition, the University is hosting two celebrations for graduating international students: a Hudson River cruise on Friday, May 2nd, and an afternoon of refreshments and hors d’oeuvres on Saturday, May 10th at Ellington in the Park.\n\nI know there isn’t a program or meeting that will fully restore the sense of trust and security that has been shaken in recent weeks and will likely be tested again in the future. I also want to say that we continue to be deeply concerned about Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, members of our community who have been detained, and other current and former students who have been directly affected by current government actions.\n\n\n\nInternational students and scholars are vital to Columbia’s education and research missions, and to our identity. You have come from all over the world to study, teach, and discover here; the climate of fear and anxiety that’s been created is heartbreaking. Non-citizen students, faculty, and staff have told me they are avoiding international travel and activities on campus. They are resigning from roles as student leaders and are afraid to attend campus events or even gather in groups. Freedom of expression, for every student, is integral to our academic mission. Every individual in this country, citizen and non-citizen alike, deserves the due process rights afforded them by law.\n\n\n\nThis chill not only weakens our community—it undercuts our national interests. Our universities attract the most talented students and scholars from around the world—more than a million came last year. Much analysis has already been done on the impact of that loss on our economy and society.\n\n\n\nFor Columbia, international is simply essential. I am inspired by the many ways I’ve seen people come together to assist our international students and their families. I am also grateful to our many colleagues across the campuses who have spoken out and acted to ensure that our international community is seen, heard, and respected. I will continue to do the same.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\n\n\nOne thing has become abundantly clear to me since I stepped into the role of Acting President last month: To navigate this moment successfully, we need to activate and mobilize the remarkable wisdom and talent of the entire Columbia community.\n\n\n\nBy training perhaps, and certainly by temperament, I am a listener. I am doing a lot of that now, and I am learning a lot quickly. I’ve heard from faculty and students in all parts of the University who have insights and perspectives into the challenges we face. You are not only asking me hard questions, which I welcome, but also offering creative and workable ideas on how we can move forward as a University. I am especially grateful for the concern members of our community consistently are showing, not only for themselves and their own priorities, but for others—other students, other colleagues. Your insistence that all parts of our community be heard at this time is inspiring, and it guides my decision making.\n\n\n\nTo focus more strategically and benefit from our community’s perspectives and insights, I’m launching a number of initiatives that I hope will help our community immediately and better position Columbia to thrive in the coming decades and centuries.\n\n\n\nI’m eager to create more channels for input. I’m currently guided by several student and faculty groups, and I will continue to work with them on a wide range of academic and policy matters. I meet with all bodies frequently, and, as I told students this week, I need to hear from them more often, especially regarding the critical challenges facing our international student community.\n\n\n\nIn addition, I plan to establish two additional working groups made up of faculty, researchers, and staff. One will focus on how Columbia can best communicate our values, our mission, and impact more effectively, both internally and to a public increasingly skeptical of higher education. Both within and beyond our campuses, we need to understand the sources of discontent with Columbia and identify what we can do to rebuild credibility and confidence with different stakeholders. The second working group will focus on strategic resilience and explore the ways in which Columbia can reimagine its financial model and institutional autonomy and how we might advocate collectively for a more sustainable future for higher education.\n\n\n\nFinally, let me turn to the critical issue of shared governance. A consistent theme that has emerged from the many conversations I’ve had in recent weeks, indeed, even the last few years, is the nature of shared governance at our University—how we work together, and how essential that is.\n\n\n\nTo be clear: I am deeply committed to shared governance and the values that represents, which manifest themselves in many ways across the University, from our faculty-led hiring, promotion, and tenure processes to the many committees charged with academic reviews, policy, and planning. Our model does not always make sense to those outside Columbia, but we know it is the essential characteristic that makes American research universities—this University—the envy of the world.\n\n\n\nThe University Senate has long played a key role for many in this University. I have benefitted from its guidance. I have heard for years, however, from many across our institution—and certainly since moving into Low Library—that the Senate’s systems need support, especially in meeting moments of crisis. Many express concerns that the Senate is not as representative of the whole community as we need it to be. Many also believe the election process does not provide adequate opportunities for fresh perspectives. Like almost all of our University bodies, the Senate was not built to function efficiently and effectively in intensely challenging moments like this.\n\n\n\nWe need to have an open conversation about how to create a Senate model that represents the complexity of our institution while enabling us to respond to the demands of the moment. In the next few weeks, I plan to consult across the University, to prepare for a review of the University Senate, to support, preserve and strengthen our shared governance model.\n\n\n\nI have asked our leadership team, senators, key faculty members, deans, and members of the board to join me in this work, to ensure that we gather input from the entire community in this process. I have heard repeatedly that our University, and our leadership, would benefit from being less siloed. I am hoping this can be a start to that process. If the Senate is to fulfill its original mission, everyone at Columbia must participate in this moment of introspection.\n\n\n\nThe point of this exercise is to seek diverse perspectives and thoughtful input to ensure our shared governance structure best serves our community now and for the future, and to create a review process that will take place this summer with recommendations before the start of the fall semester.\n\n\n\nIt is moments like this, where our systems, habits, practices, and ideas are tested and sometimes strained, that can produce the most creative and innovative results. As has happened multiple times in our history, moments of struggle can create healthy change.\n\n\n\nThe University Senate’s role in our governance system, developed more than 50 years ago, was meant to help the University recover from an earlier moment of stress and strife. Columbia President Michael Sovern, who, as a faculty member, proposed the creation of the Senate, said this about its mission: “The Senate allowed for a representative forum where all issues could be fairly heard.” We need that forum more than ever today, and I would like to ask the community to engage in constructive dialogue about what best practices could look like, and how this very process, rather than dividing, might start to move us forward together.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Columbia Community:\n\nOver the past few weeks, days, indeed over the past few hours, you have no doubt seen and heard much about Columbia and the future of higher education. This is an extraordinary and difficult time for our University. We face unprecedented pressures, with no easy answers and many uncertainties. That combination is creating significant anxiety for our community, and we must, as we navigate this moment, stay true to our core mission as an educational and research institution, and true to our community.\n\nI’ve heard deep concern about when and whether we will get our research funding back, what form an agreement with the government would take, whether we would have to compromise our values to reach such an agreement, and what we’re doing to support our international students right now. Let me attempt to address each of these issues.\n\nAs we have shared before, the University has been engaged in what we continue to believe to be good faith discussions with the Federal Task Force to Combat Antisemitism. We have sought to address allegations of antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination on our campuses, and provide a path to restoring a partnership with the federal government that supports our vital research mission, while also protecting the University’s academic and operational integrity and independence.\n\nThose discussions have not concluded, and we have not reached any agreement with the government at this point. Some of the government’s requests have aligned with policies and practices that we believe are important to advancing our mission, particularly to provide a safe and inclusive campus community. I stand firmly behind the commitments we outlined on March 21, and all the work that has been done to date. Other ideas, including overly prescriptive requests about our governance, how we conduct our presidential search process, and how specifically to address viewpoint diversity issues are not subject to negotiation.\n\nTo be clear, our institution may decide at any point, on its own, to make difficult decisions that are in Columbia’s best interests. Any good institution must do that. Where the government – or any stakeholder – has legitimate interest in critical issues for our healthy functioning, we will listen and respond. But we would reject heavy-handed orchestration from the government that could potentially damage our institution and undermine useful reforms that serve the best interests of our students and community. We would reject any agreement in which the government dictates what we teach, research, or who we hire. And yes, to put minds at ease, though we seek to continue constructive dialogue with the government, we would reject any agreement that would require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.\n\nLike many of you, I read with great interest the message from Harvard refusing the federal government’s demands for changes to policies and practices that would strike at the very heart of that university’s venerable mission. In this moment, a continued public conversation about the value and principles of higher education is enormously useful. I am especially concerned that many Americans have lost faith and trust in higher education. We should continue the hard work of understanding why. At the same time, we must more clearly explain what we here, at Columbia, know instinctively about the vital contributions we make to the world.\n\nI want to turn to our international students, who are essential to our unique and powerful ecosystem, and who are experiencing enormous distress. We have been following with great concern the various actions being taken by the federal government toward members of our community. We know this has provoked not only anxiety, but multiple new, day-to-day challenges for our international student community. For that reason, the University launched a new University fund, supported by my office, our Board of Trustees, and generous alumni, to assist students who need help managing unanticipated expenses and other challenges right now.\n\nThis comes alongside our recently announced commitment of additional resources to our International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) to expand their ability to help our international students, through logistical, legal, and mental health support, including a significant expansion of hours and staff resources. I’m pleased to announce a new website dedicated to these efforts.\n\nWe are navigating a turbulent time for higher education. The challenges ahead of us are formidable. Knowing Columbia as I do, and as you do, I am confident that we will get through this to serve our students, faculty, staff, and society for centuries to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\nIt’s been just under a week since I stepped into this new role. Thank you to all who have taken the time to welcome me and to share your thoughts. I want to take a minute to address some of the key questions I’ve heard this week.\n\nFirst, the commitments the University made to address antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination, which were outlined on March 21, are now my commitments, and work is underway to continue their implementation. We are not changing course. I believe the plans, many of which were already underway, are the right thing to do, and good for our institution. I’ve seen, firsthand, the devastating impact of antisemitism on our community. I also understand the pain of having our institution labeled this way. But that doesn’t mean we should shy away from addressing a very real problem.\n\nSecond, we are proceeding, with integrity and care, in our discussions with the federal government about restoring our research funding. Our relationships with multiple federal agencies are longstanding; they are essential research partners for us. We hope to resume those partnerships soon. I am aware of the deep anxiety affecting our research community, and we’ve taken great care to provide as much transparency as possible, including making a near-term commitment to pay the salaries and stipends of those affected, as we work to restore funding and consider alternative funding mechanisms.\n\nThird, I also want to acknowledge the deep fear and uncertainty being felt at this moment in our international community. I see you, and I hear you, and the University administration is, and I am, deeply concerned for all our international students and scholars. Our international community is essential to driving excellence here, in scholarship and research. I’ll also take this moment to put some rumors to rest. No member of the leadership team or the Board of Trustees ever notified ICE about any members of our community. Full stop. And we are watching these cases carefully.\n\nWe are committed to supporting our international community in any way possible for us. I’ve asked our team to substantially increase our funding and hours for our International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO), so that our advisors are more readily available to help. Let me also make this clear—Columbia doesn’t have the ultimate authority, and we’re committed to following the law.\n\nFinally, I know it is surprising to see me in this role. And let me assure you, the word “acting” is intentional. I didn’t seek this position; I was asked to step in during this difficult moment to provide continuity while a search process, which will include the community and faculty, gets underway. I am committed to navigating Columbia through this moment to the best of my ability.\n\nI have more listening to do, and you will continue to hear from me. I am eager to see you on campus and at all the many activities as our Commencement season gets underway. Thank you for your engagement, your passion, and your unwavering commitment to our University.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community,\n\n\n\nToday, I write to you in my new capacity as Acting President. I do so with awe for the role, reverence for this institution, and clarity about our challenges. Ornamental language can’t disguise the fact that this is a precarious moment for Columbia University. In serving our community and navigating what’s to come, I pledge to be as transparent as possible, and to work as hard as I can to do right by a place that is so critical to all of us, and to the world.\n\n\n\nThere is no overstating the influence Columbia has had on my life. When I arrived on College Walk in 1982, I wasn’t your typical student. I had transferred into the first class of women, not appreciating that fact at the time. I grew up in the Midwest, and I wasn’t particularly well-versed in the Ivy League. What I found here was a place that ignited my curiosity and drive to explore. As is the case for so many students, I arrived at Columbia, and something clicked. I recognized myself.\n\n\n\nThis is what happens at Columbia. We love the sharp argument, the intellectual sprawl, the sense that anything feels possible. I returned for graduate school and then served on the SIPA Advisory Board, the College Board of Visitors, and the Board of Trustees, hooked on all the ways this remarkable place keeps pushing the frontiers of scholarship and discovery.\n\n\n\nI want to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Katrina Armstrong for taking on the challenge of stepping in as Interim President, and for her heroic efforts over the past seven months.\n\n\n\nOver the coming days and weeks, I hope to meet and talk with as many of you as I can. If you see me, please come and say hello. I want to hear from you, and I would welcome input about how we can build a shared sense of community.\n\n\n\nWe will continue to build on the significant progress we’ve made, and the plan outlined to move our community forward.\n\n\n\nTo be clear—our task is not an easy one. But a skill Columbia teaches all of us is perseverance; my request, right now, is that we all—students, faculty, staff, and everyone in this remarkable place—come together and work to protect and support this invaluable repository of knowledge, this home to the next generation of intellectual explorers, and this place of great and continuing promise.\n\n\n\nI look forward to seeing you on campus.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "I am pleased to share that Ethan Pollock, Abbott Gleason University Professor of History and Professor of Slavic Studies, has been appointed Brown’s next Dean of the College, effective July 1, 2025.\n\nEthan is an exceptionally thoughtful scholar with a deep understanding and appreciation for the College and a commitment to ensuring that students can fully access the singular academic experience that Brown offers. For nearly 20 years, he has embodied Brown’s mission and values through his teaching, research and effective leadership, driven by vision, energy and empathy. His experience as an accomplished educator, researcher, adviser and academic department leader position him for success in this new role.\n\nAs dean, Ethan will serve as Brown’s senior officer with oversight of undergraduate programs, whose responsibilities include overseeing the University’s student-centered Open Curriculum, academic advising, study abroad, undergraduate research opportunities and career exploration. He will oversee the undergraduate academic deans and staff responsible for administering instruction and research in support of Brown’s more than 7,200 undergraduate students. In the role, Ethan will report to me and serve as a member of the president’s cabinet, the president’s executive committee and the provost’s leadership group of senior academic deans, which coordinates academic priorities across the University.\n\nEthan brings phenomenal perspective to this role, and his background and strengths will complement our other senior leaders’ expertise in engineering, biology and medicine, public health and the more quantitative social sciences. Ethan joined the Brown faculty in 2006 and has served as chair of the Department of History since 2020. In that role, he has excelled at serving the different needs of students, faculty and staff, leading one of the largest academic departments at Brown, advancing the curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students and expanding collaborations with other departments, centers and institutes at the University.\n\nHe holds a bachelor’s degree in history from Tufts University as well as master’s and Ph.D. degrees in history from the University of California, Berkeley. He spent two years as a U.S. history teacher in Moscow before earning his doctorate and has served as a fellow at George Washington University, Columbia University, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and the European University Institute. From 2003 to 2006, he was an assistant professor of history at Syracuse University. At Brown, he has taught courses on Russian and Soviet history, the nuclear age and the Cold War. In 2016, he was presented with the University’s William G. McLoughlin Prize for Teaching Excellence in the Social Sciences. He is the author of two books, a range of scholarly articles and his research and writing have been funded by a wide spectrum of organizations.\n\nEthan will succeed Professor of Engineering and Physics Rashid Zia, whose instrumental leadership of the College over the last seven years has strengthened Brown’s distinctive approach to academic advising, experiential learning, study abroad, financial support for students and career exploration.\n\nI am incredibly grateful to the students, faculty and staff who served on the search committee. I also deeply appreciate the outpouring of interest in candidacy from many well-qualified members of our faculty, which made the selection process all the more challenging. I look forward to working closely with Ethan to guide and strengthen the academic experience for our undergraduates, and I hope you’ll join me in welcoming him to his new role this summer.",

    "url": "https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/provost/communications/update-choices-program",
    "content": "I am writing today with an important update on the Choices Program, an initiative housed in the history department at Brown with a mission to increase access to high-quality curricular content and strengthen education about history and current events in secondary schools in the U.S. and beyond.\n\nWhile Choices has enjoyed a long history of providing content to teachers and school districts across the country, a detailed assessment of the program’s finances and organization has made clear that it is no longer economically viable in its current structure at Brown. Expenses for the program have significantly exceeded revenue for multiple recent fiscal years, an imbalance that is expected to worsen and cannot be responsibly and sustainably managed by existing University resources. For the past several months, we have been assessing the Choices Program in the context of the University’s financial sustainability efforts to address the structural deficit in its operating budget, as well as the increasing uncertainty about potential financial impacts of federal government actions and ongoing shifts in the national economic landscape.\n\nWe have made the difficult but necessary decision amid these financial headwinds that Brown will discontinue hosting the Choices Program, while its administrative leaders remain free to consider continuing the initiative as a separate entity independent of Brown’s resources and sponsorship. We are sharing this decision with the full community given the program’s history and engagement with faculty and other stakeholders across the University spanning decades.\n\nEven as we face the need to end the University’s sponsorship of the program, we recognize and appreciate its decades-long positive impact. Choices originated more than 30 years ago in the academic programs that today comprise the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. Its original mission was to help secondary school students understand contemporary policy choices, and the program evolved over time both to present scholarship on a wider range of policy choices and also to make that scholarship accessible to high school students. Topics explored in the program’s curricular materials range from the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the Civil Rights Movement, to timely issues such as nuclear weapons expansions, U.S. policies on foreign aid, the origins of conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, and Russian-American relations.\n\nAs the program expanded its reach, it continued to create curricula relevant to policy decisions nationally and around the globe, but rooted in historical scholarship. In 2018, the program moved to Brown’s Department of History, as a self-funded unit, and its historical focus was reinforced. The decision around that time to shift to a digital model, in which educational materials could be purchased online, was critical for sustaining the program financially, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid move to remote learning in 2020. More demand for digital curricula, and increased government funding to school systems during and after the pandemic, allowed the program to be financially successful during this period.\n\nIn recent years, however, the program has faced both financial and staffing challenges, and the outlook for future curriculum sales appears to be weaker than in prior years. In Summer 2024, Deputy Provost Janet Blume and Dean of the Faculty Leah VanWey began working with the history department and Choices Program staff to assess the financial and organizational status of the program and to review possible pathways forward. This assessment took on heightened urgency as Brown leaders began considering additional financial measures in recent months to address the University’s persisting budget deficit, and to plan for potential external impacts on major revenue streams. This includes potential threats to federal funding, uncertainty around economic volatility that could have an impact on Brown’s endowment, and a potential increase on the federal tax on college and university endowments.\n\nThese factors led to the decision for the University to discontinue hosting Choices. We made this decision after consultation with leaders from the history department and shared this difficult news with Choices staff on Thursday, while also conveying that the program’s leaders may choose to explore establishing the initiative as a separate, independent entity that would not be financed or hosted by Brown. Deputy Provost Blume and Dean VanWey will work with the history department and Choices staff with the expectation that Brown’s sponsorship of the program will end by June 30, 2025. Program staff will receive support services as part of Brown’s ongoing commitment to support its community members, and the University will notify all active customers and vendors to end current contracts and provide guidance on the implications of this transition for them.\n\nFor more than 30 years, the Choices Program has provided carefully researched scholarship to help educators teach about challenging issues. We are committed to supporting customers of the program during this transition.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III, Provost",

    "url": "https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/provost/communications/responding-questions-about-government-actions",
    "content": "After a series of town hall meetings and listening sessions to give campus community members opportunities to ask questions related to federal government actions and Brown's response, we are writing to provide students, faculty and staff with information about some of the recurring questions we have received. We also know there are both new and persisting concerns prompted by news media reports about potential actions the government may be preparing to implement.\n\nSome of the most common questions we have received recently deal with the government's enforcement actions related to the autonomy of universities to govern their academic operations; revocation and termination of research funding; immigration and citizenship status; diversity and inclusion initiatives; and the transgender community. In addition, we have received questions regarding whether student conduct records could play a role in federal actions; how security footage is retained at Brown; and principles related to protest and demonstration. This letter provides information that we have shared in various town halls and campus meetings, understanding that many in our community may not have been able to attend.\n\nFirst and foremost, we want to reiterate that we are unwavering in our diligence in monitoring and assessing all new and evolving federal guidance and announcements to identify the most effective ways to protect Brown’s mission and support members of our community related to these and other questions. We remain acutely aware of the anxiety that some members of our community are feeling. At the same time, we hope to build some shared understanding that there are many questions that Brown, and institutions of higher education in general, do not have the information to answer. It would be a true disservice to our community to provide guidance or offer any assurances based on assumptions or predictions, which in turn might prompt members of our community to make decisions or engage in activities based on what are truly unknowns. This continues to be a time of tremendous uncertainty, and the guidance we provide and our compliance with the law aligns directly with our commitment to support the safety and well-being of our community within the bounds of an evolving legal and policy landscape.\n\nGovernment intervention into academic freedom and free inquiry\n\nGovernment actions to impose conditions on peer universities in return for reversing cuts in federal funding are contributing to ongoing questions about Brown's commitment to safeguarding academic freedom. These are the most common questions we continue to receive. Some are asking detailed questions about protecting courses and scholarly study on specific topics at Brown.\n\nPresident Paxson in her message to the community on March 20 directly addressed the University’s commitment to defend freedom of expression and academic freedom. She assured the community that the institution would be compelled to exercise our legal rights vigorously if faced with government encroachment on the autonomy necessary for Brown to perform essential academic and operational functions to advance our academic mission. While faculty, staff and students continue to share concerns related to specific course titles or areas of disciplinary study, the University cannot predict or speculate about future government actions. However, in every town hall, forum and communication to the community, we continue to reiterate that Brown is committed to defending the ability of faculty and students to study and learn freely and without fear of censorship in advancement of our institutional mission. This commitment to protecting academic freedom applies both for the University as an institution and for individual members of our community of scholars and learners.\n\nStatus of funding to conduct research\n\nThe research community at Brown continues to have deep concerns about a small but growing number of terminations of federal research grants, which was reported widely by news media last week. While initial questions from Brown faculty, graduate students and research staff in our town halls and other settings focused on grant approvals, we are hearing new uncertainty related to the potential for terminations of existing grants, as well as program revisions resulting from executive orders and new priorities of the current federal administration.\n\nWhile any number is significant, currently Brown has seen the termination of about 1 percent of existing research grants, including those for which Brown was the primary award recipient and others for which Brown was a subgrantee. While the bases for the terminations are not consistently clear, they relate to grants from agencies including the National Institutes of Health, Office of Naval Research, the State Department and NASA, all for research that seems to include considerations of gender, race, or diversity, equity and inclusion. According to the Association of American Universities and the Council on Governmental Relations, two associations focused on research institutions, grants could also be terminated in the coming months based on the rationale that they support projects focusing on anthropogenic climate change and links between climate and health.\n\nTeams in Brown's Division of Research (DOR), Office of Government Relations (OGR) and Office of General Counsel (OGC) are working closely and extensively with the leadership of Brown's academic units to understand the impact of these unprecedented revocations of existing research grants, including exploring options for appeal and potential legal action. However, we are encouraged that Brown continues to receive funds from both new and continuing grants, and researchers are continuing to submit proposals at a rate similar to or slightly above 2024 levels.\n\nFaculty and staff are seeking highly individualized information, and we are committed to being responsive to their questions. Faculty or staff with concerns about specific research proposals and their relationship or exposure to federal actions should continue to contact DOR via the email established for questions about federal actions: [email protected]. Teams in DOR and OGC remain deeply committed to supporting our research community. Faculty also are being encouraged to contact their program officers to discuss the impact of federal actions on research proposals, and to share directly with DOR any pertinent information you receive regarding the current state of affairs with your funding agency. This information can help inform the University's understanding of rapidly evolving government actions.\n\nMost important, DOR encourages members of our research community to continue submitting research proposals. Beyond supporting Brown's research enterprise, maintaining a high volume of submissions to federal funding agencies makes an important statement for the national research community. Any decrease in proposal submissions could negatively influence future federal budgets.\n\nThe University continues to provide guidance and resources supporting the pursuit of federal research funding. During the month of April, DOR is coordinating a series of events in support of faculty's research funding needs. These include a panel of faculty discussing their experiences in securing industry sponsored research; a proposal-writing workshop co-led by the Council on Federal Relations focused on funding opportunities in public health; and a webinar presentation on funding priorities in the government's Fiscal Year 2026 budget. In addition, DOR’s Research Strategy and Development team is available for strategic consultation on a range of strategies, including how to optimize funding searches using Brown's university-wide funding opportunity database.\n\nSafety for the international community related to travel\n\nMembers of our community naturally continue to ask whether Brown has more information about travel bans or restrictions affecting individuals from various countries. Since our last update to the Brown community on federal immigration actions, no new or renewed travel restrictions or bans have been announced by the government. The University generally does not receive advance notice of any such restrictions or information about the list of countries or timing of future actions, though we continue to monitor developments closely.\n\nThe Office of Global Engagement (OGE), in partnership with the Global Brown Center, has launched new educational resources and expanded advising hours to support international students and scholars. In addition to a \"Know Your Rights\" webinar series led by immigration attorneys and the Department of Public Safety in March, multiple sessions throughout April will address a range of topics. In addition, OGE continues to maintain the Status Inquiry FAQ webpage, which shares these resources while also providing guidance for students, staff and faculty. This resource is continuously updated as new information becomes available, such as the international travel guidance shared with the campus prior to the Spring Recess.\n\nBeyond these community-wide initiatives, the Office of International Student and Scholar Services (OISSS) also provides targeted outreach to individual members of affected communities. The office regularly communicates with international students and scholars who may be impacted by federal regulations, sending reminders and information about relevant resources. Some of these communications are also available on the OISSS announcements page.\n\nSome members of our community are aware that, on March 12, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a forthcoming rule that will require all non-citizens aged 14 and older who stay in the U.S. for more than 30 days to register, submit fingerprints and report any address changes to DHS. Non-compliance will result in penalties. This rule is set to take effect on April 11, 2025, and while we understand that this has prompted deep concerns, we regret we do not have information about how the government might use this registration information related to travel or otherwise.\n\nUnder the new rule, U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders), all U.S. visa holders, individuals granted parole (such as Humanitarian Parole), DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival) and TPS (Temporary Protected Status) recipients, and refugees are considered already registered under existing immigration processes. The Association for American Universities, the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and our other professional associations have submitted formal comments and feedback on this proposed rule. We will continue to monitor the situation closely as the April 11 deadline approaches. Please refer to the OGE website for ongoing updates, particularly if you believe you might be affected by the new rule.\n\nPotential for immigration enforcement on campus\n\nWe continue to receive detailed questions about how the University would respond to government requests regarding citizenship or immigration status, as well as any potential for government immigration enforcement on campus. The assurance we continue to give is that Brown is fully committed to supporting members of the Brown community within the law, and the University will work directly with any student, faculty or staff member in need of assistance and support in a manner commensurate with this commitment and appropriate to the facts and circumstances of any individual situation.\n\nBrown's Department of Public Safety is our community's resource for remaining knowledgeable about government protocols related to immigration enforcement. However, DPS does not inquire about or act on information related to immigration status and does not partner with federal or state agencies to do so. If government agents were to arrive on or off campus for an unannounced site visit, we are directing faculty, students and staff to call DPS at 401-863-4111, and staff in the DPS communications center will notify the appropriate university officials. As noted above, we continue to direct international students, faculty and staff to the guidance currently available on the webpage offering FAQs and resources on the OGE website. This ongoing resource explains that Brown will only share information with law enforcement regarding the immigration status of community members under a valid subpoena.\n\nThat being said, it is important that all faculty, students and staff understand that federal enforcement officers, like state and local law enforcement officers, have jurisdiction on campus, including the Brown University campus (as do police for Providence and the State of Rhode Island). Federal law officers can carry out their statutory duties where they have lawful jurisdiction and authority to do so. Neither Brown nor any other organization has discretion or authority to stop them from doing so. As Brown complies with the law, DPS is prepared to respond to any on-campus interactions with federal or other officers and provide support as appropriate to members of the Brown community.\n\nWhile some members of our community have asked what the University would do in response to a valid subpoena, it would not be responsible or appropriate to make commitments or predictions. The facts and circumstances of any individual situation can be infinitely variable, and we are sensitive to the implications of providing information that might be taken as an assurance or legal guidance in an ever-changing policy landscape. What we can say is that the University remains steadfast in following the law precisely because of, not in spite of, a commitment to safeguard the ongoing security and well-being of members of our community. This includes maintaining the privacy of records in line with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which is described in detail in the University’s FERPA policy (including provisions governing disclosure of education records with and without consent).\n\nWe understand that some members of our community have asked the University to predict outcomes or speculate about potential University actions if individuals faced situations described in media reports as the government's response to \"support for terrorism.\" While we understand the anxiety that these situations create, there is no responsible way to make a blanket commitment in response to circumstances that are widely variable. As President Paxson shared in her March 20 campus communication, Brown has a long track record of working with our Congressional delegation, as well as our alumni networks of experts and professionals across a strong extended Brown community, to resolve visa and immigration issues with sensitivity and with respect for individual privacy.\n\nFederal efforts to dismantle diversity and inclusion\n\nWe continue to assess the implications of federal directives relating to diversity and inclusion, many of which are currently being challenged in court. The common question we have received concerns whether government actions will prompt Brown to take steps reported at some other institutions to end diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives. This adds to the fears referenced earlier in this letter about threats to federal grants for any research that has elements related diversity and inclusion.\n\nBrown remains committed to efforts to foster a strong academic community through programs that are open to all and through initiatives that aim to help all faculty, students and staff thrive, feel welcome and participate fully in the life of the University. President Paxson in February named Matthew Guterl, a professor of Africana studies and American studies at Brown, as the University’s new vice president for diversity and inclusion, which reflects an unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion at Brown as grounded in and central to our academic mission. As a leading research institution dedicated to strong student-centered education, Brown continues to recognize the critical importance of bringing diverse perspectives, knowledge and experiences to confront and solve the most complex challenges of the 21st century. This includes safeguarding the freedom to teach and study on issues related to diverse identities, viewpoints and geopolitical issues. This is part of our commitment to defending academic freedom, which we discussed earlier in this communication. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion is working closely to reassure colleagues and campus partners about the enduring value of Brown's work in diversity and inclusion.\n\nSupport for gender-affirming care\n\nReports about significant federal funding being revoked from one of our peer institutions related to allowing a transgender athlete to compete some years ago has prompted questions on our own campus specifically about whether these actions have influenced Brown's policies on gender-affirming care. The University has made no changes to care, treatment or support provided for gender-affirming care.\n\nSome of the questions we have received touch on the personal and individual circumstances of members of our community, and as with several of the topics discussed in this communication, we would not speculate about responses to potential laws or regulations that may or may not be enacted. It remains important not to offer guidance based on hypothetical situations. We are and remain fully committed to supporting all Brown students in a manner consistent with our long-established policy of nondiscrimination, which includes sex, gender identity and gender expression.\n\nThe LGBTQ Center, Student Health & Wellness Services, and other offices in the Division of Campus Life, as well as the Warren Alpert Medical School, the College, the Graduate School, Office of Diversity and Inclusion and many other offices across campus, continue to be partners in providing resources to meet the needs of our community.\n\nRetention of student records and security footage\n\nSome members of our community have asked who beyond Brown might gain or have access to student conduct records. In addition, with media reports about a focus on protests related to government actions, we have received questions about the purpose and ongoing use of cameras that capture campus activity at Brown. With regard to maintaining the privacy of such records, it is important to reiterate that the University complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Details about Brown's policies and procedures regarding student conduct records are outlined in the Student Conduct Procedures in the section explaining “Reporting and Record Retention\" (section 9). Brown maintains the integrity of these records, and would alter or expunge them only in very rare instances when we are required to do so in alignment with FERPA.\n\nRegarding secure video footage, the University's security cameras have been and continue to be a critical element of our campus safety and security environment, and it is essential to maintain our community’s safety persistently and routinely. Our policies and procedures guide the use and retention of data from cameras, or any other safety and security infrastructure, with the goal of safeguarding our community’s security. Under DPS policy, recordings from surveillance and security cameras owned and operated by the University reside on a secure network. Camera footage is stored temporarily, normally for no longer than 30 days, and then is recorded over automatically, unless the footage is evidence in an administrative, employment or court action. Brown typically will not disclose such records to outside agencies absent a valid subpoena or court order or statutory or regulatory authority.\n\nIt is important to remember that activities in any location visible to the public — whether on or off campus — are subject to being recorded given the widespread prevalence of recording devices in individual phones, public and private security cameras, and through news media coverage. The privacy protections Brown provides for its use of secure video footage do not apply to recordings made by others, which may be amplified through independent media coverage or posted by various parties on social media.\n\nAs members of our community continue to raise concerns about different forms of online harassment, including reports of trolling sites targeting faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationally based on their views, we want to direct you to the guidance on the Managing Online and Social Media Harassment webpage. This resource previously shared by the Office of University Communications and Office of Information Technology offers proactive steps that members of the Brown community can take to help prevent and respond to instances of trolling, cyberbullying and doxxing.\n\nProtest policy and free expression\n\nReports of federal actions against student protestors at other institutions has prompted questions at town halls with students and others about Brown's protest policies. As we have noted, fundamental to advancing Brown's academic mission is the commitment to academic freedom and freedom of expression. Protest is an acceptable means of this expression within our community, and Brown's policy for protests aligns with the principle that “members of the community shall enjoy full freedom in their teaching, learning, and research.” This has not changed.\n\nProtest becomes unacceptable when it obstructs the free exchange of ideas, and this also has not changed. The University’s Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy clearly defines what constitutes prohibited conduct and further states that the policy does not inhibit nor restrict free expression or exchange of ideas, including the expression of beliefs. In September of last year, Executive Vice President Russell Carey shared two letters with the campus community further explaining this policy and providing examples of behaviors that could constitute discrimination or harassment. This guidance is readily accessible online alongside other Campus Life messages sent to our community. It is important that all students, faculty and staff remain knowledgeable about the policy, and we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the previous communications. When revisions and updates are made to these existing policies, we communicate broadly to the campus community.\n\nIn closing\n\nWe want to reiterate that we appreciate and understand the concerns, anxiety and confusion that many Brown community members are experiencing as a result of federal orders, agency directives and government actions. Ongoing court challenges and other legal actions contribute to uncertainty about shifts in policy and the law.\n\nWe know there will continue to be new questions about research funding, immigration, federal actions related to university governance, and the other issues we have discussed in this letter, as well as other emerging topics. A working group that brings together expertise at Brown in government relations, research, support for international issues, public policy, the law and other areas will continue to address the implications of federal actions on an ongoing basis. In addition, offices across the University continue to engage directly with various communities affected by evolving policies to provide support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III, Provost\n\nRussell C. Carey, Executive Vice President for Planning & Policy; Interim Vice President for Campus Life",

    "content": "We are writing with important information and updates regarding strategies and actions to address the University's structural budget deficit and ongoing financial sustainability. As Brown continues to assess the potential significant impacts of federal government actions and ongoing shifts in the national economic landscape, the University has to take more immediate steps than the actions previously announced for Fiscal Year 2026, beginning with the current fiscal year.\n\nIn this communication, we outline the following actions and provide background and context for these decisions:\n\nProceeding with faculty and staff compensation increases for FY26, as planned\n\nInstituting a mandatory salary freeze for members of the President’s Cabinet and a voluntary freeze for other highly compensated administrators\n\nInstituting a temporary staff hiring freeze, effective immediately\n\nFreezing non-essential travel, effective immediately\n\nSlowing FY25 discretionary spending, effective immediately\n\nIt's important to note that, in all we do, we maintain deep commitments to Brown's mission and to treating our community with dignity and respect. We must be able to persist in educating talented students from around the world and supporting the excellent research and scholarly study of our faculty. And we must support to the greatest extent possible the staff and operations that sustain our community of teachers and learners. The actions being put into place to address our financial challenges calls for a shared commitment to work together to implement solutions that support the core priorities of our community.\n\nPlanning Within an Evolving National Financial Landscape\n\nAs President Paxson communicated in her campus message last week, and we communicated in December, Brown’s administrative leaders have been actively working to navigate the federal government actions that pose ongoing challenges to our core academic mission of education and research, to the ability of some members of our community to continue to participate fully in the life of the University, and to various academic and administrative operations. In October, we wrote to you about the Financial Health Initiative we launched to address Brown’s structural budget deficit, which if left unaddressed, will continue to grow. This work has become increasingly urgent as we continue these budget efforts against the current backdrop of increased financial uncertainty owing to the evolving federal landscape.\n\nIn this environment, it is critical to proactively position ourselves to withstand the potential fiscal impacts with as minimal long-term negative consequences to our mission of teaching and research as possible. To that end, prudence dictates that we must slow our financial commitments to the greatest extent possible at least through the remainder of this fiscal year. We have engaged in extensive analysis of Brown’s spending and financial operations and carefully developed several actions to strengthen our financial position and navigate these challenges effectively. These steps are in addition to the actions President Paxson outlined in her message last week, which noted the cancellation of several faculty searches, the decision to leave several staff vacancies unfilled, and the reduction of Ph.D. admissions targets across a number of Brown’s graduate programs.\n\nThese actions, and those outlined below, are taking place at the same time we have begun reviewing the FY26 unit-level budget submissions. We are deeply grateful for the thoughtful and meticulous work that went into the preparation of these submissions. We asked units to assume flat budgets, at best, in the budget planning guidance issued in the fall. In addition, each unit was asked to develop a downside scenario for further expense reduction below their current budgets. This is a best practice for any organization, as unit heads should always plan for potential financial downturns. We now anticipate needing to implement many of the actions included in the downside scenarios submitted for the FY26 cycle. We will be meeting with unit heads over the next several weeks to review their submissions in depth and discuss their proposed downside actions. The budget will then be presented to the University Resources Committee, the joint committee of faculty, staff, students and senior administrators, and they will make a recommendation to President Paxson. The Corporation will vote on the budget at its May meeting.\n\nMaintaining Compensation Increases for FY26, as Planned\n\nIn February, President Paxson announced that the Corporation had approved 3.5% salary pools for both faculty and staff in FY26, including 1% base, 1.75% merit, and 0.75% for promotions, retention and equity. As noted in that February communication, annual increases for faculty and staff may not reflect the total 3.5% designated for the salary pool due to the different components of the pools. In addition, in President Paxson’s Response to the Faculty Compensation Task Force, she asked that the Provost “establish a fund of $2.5 million that will be used to make one-time market adjustments to the compensation of longer-serving, productive faculty.”\n\nOne of the guiding principles we have continued to underscore in our communications over the last few months is our focus on continuing to pay current faculty and staff at competitive rates. As a result, at this point in time, we are planning to proceed with implementing these increases for faculty and staff. Though this reflects our current plans for FY26 compensation, we are operating in a very fluid environment, and if we need to adjust the University’s approach, we will communicate any changes to the Brown community. But again, for now, we are moving forward with implementing the announced increases for faculty and staff.\n\nHowever, one additional step for FY26 will be a compensation freeze for members of the President’s Cabinet. President Paxson has decided that members of the President's Cabinet will not be eligible for compensation increases – base or merit – in FY26. In addition, earlier this week, we reached out to other highly compensated administrators, who are not Cabinet members, to invite them to participate in a voluntary salary freeze for FY26. In addition to this compensation freeze, President Paxson and both of us, will each be taking a 10% salary cut.\n\nStaff Hiring Freeze and Ongoing Vacancy Review\n\nBrown’s single largest expense is compensation for our exceptional employees. Investing in our staff is an import\n\nant priority, but we must focus on slowing the growth of salary and benefit costs to preserve as many current jobs as possible. Beginning in January of this year, as part of the Financial Health Initiative, we put in place new measures to closely assess open staff positions. As Brown faces increased financial challenges, managing costs through the elimination of vacant positions, and therefore minimizing the number of potential layoffs of filled positions, remains our preferred strategy. We have eliminated over 50 vacant positions since January, creating savings through attrition.\n\nBased on the uncertainty we now face from federal actions, we need to be more proactive in managing Brown’s expenditures.Therefore, effective immediately, we are instituting a temporary staff hiring freeze. This freeze will remain in effect through the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year. The freeze applies to all staff positions with any component of unrestricted funds. We will work with unit heads to make determinations about staff positions that are currently posted and with searches nearing completion in the recruitment pipeline. An exemption process will be in place for positions that:\n\nif left vacant, would have significant adverse impact on critical academic operations, research, student services and administrative functions;\n\nare essential to ensure compliance with regulatory and legal requirements;\n\nsupport critical infrastructure, IT or other system maintenance; and/or\n\nare required to ensure campus health and safety.\n\nStaff searches approved as exceptions to the hiring freeze will use an expanded Brown First recruitment model, prioritizing internal recruitment. If a position requires specialized experience or credentials incompatible with a Brown First recruitment approach, a search process including external candidates may be approved. Additional details on this process will be provided to unit heads and HR Business Partners.\n\nWe recognize that not filling positions will pose workload challenges. We will continue to use current policies and processes to provide additional compensation to staff who are required to assume temporary additional duties that are beyond the scope of their normal job responsibilities for specified periods of time.\n\nOne of the most impactful actions academic and administrative units can take now is to review the work performed by staff to identify opportunities to restructure operations and re-envision how services are provided. This moment provides an important opportunity to ask fresh questions about the body of work that units do, how it gets done, and what services might need to be reduced or eliminated. We have seen a number of great examples of this innovation in units that are already navigating decreased headcounts, and we are planning opportunities to share best practices and provide support to units that are undertaking this important work.\n\nReducing Travel and Discretionary Expenses\n\nTravel is an area with significant unrestricted expenses across Brown, and offers an opportunity for our community to slow discretionary spending for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a result, we are putting in place an immediate freeze on non-essential travel. Essential travel is that which is contractually obligated, deemed essential because there are no alternatives for engagement or virtual options, or determined to be necessary to avoid a negative impact on core operations, research, academics, revenue generation, etc. Unit heads should ensure they are reviewing travel plans accordingly and slowing expenses to the greatest extent possible. Generally speaking, unit heads should only permit non-essential travel if it is fully paid for and refunds are not possible.\n\nWe are also directing all units to reduce, slow and/or defer other categories of discretionary spending, effective immediately. This includes reducing spending on meals, catering, events, supplies, and the use of external consultants to the fullest extent possible. These expenditures can add up across campus, and the more intentional we are in our spending decisions, the better our community can prepare for potential fiscal challenges in the months ahead. Unit heads should determine what internal processes they might use to slow these expenses. Please note that requests submitted to Senior Officers to approve exceptions to business meal and hospitality policies will generally not be granted.\n\nIn addition to all of the actions outlined above, we continue to conduct scenario planning for various potential financial impacts emerging from federal actions. We recognize the current environment, and associated uncertainty, is very challenging and stressful. We know that engagement with our campus community, partnership in problem solving, and proactive communications will be critical throughout this time. Brown’s mission, and the impact we make in the world, is vital. This makes it essential that we undertake this important work collectively to strengthen our financial health.\n\nIn Closing\n\nWhile there continues to be significant uncertainty about the full financial impact of the ongoing volatility of the national economic landscape, it is critical that we take steps now to ensure the financial health of the University. We thank our colleagues across the University who continue to contribute thoughtful leadership and partnership as we work together to find solutions.\n\nOur goal, now and into the future, is to position Brown to effectively advance our teaching, learning, and research mission while adhering, as best we can, to our ever true principles for financial management and continuing to treat all community members with dignity and respect. Thank you for your partnership and service to Brown as we move forward\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III, Provost\n\nSarah Latham, Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration",

    "content": "Amid the early weeks of the federal government transition, we know that executive orders and policy statements from federal agencies continue to raise questions for members of our community. Over the course of coming weeks, Brown senior administrators are continuing to participate in listening sessions and town halls to give campus community members opportunities to ask questions related to recent federal government actions and Brown's response.\n\nAll Brown staff, including regular, term and seasonal positions, as well as postdocs, are invited to a virtual town hall on Wednesday, February 26, from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. This follows an all-faculty town hall co-hosted by the Office of the Provost and the Faculty Executive Committee on Feb. 13.\n\nOn Thursday, Feb. 27, chairs of the DIAP committees of Brown academic and administrative departments have been invited to an in-person session co-hosted by the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity and the Office of the Provost. Invitees received details via email, as this is for DIAP committee chairs only.\n\nIn addition, some of Brown's schools are hosting town halls for their respective communities this spring to speak about issues specific to their schools, while administrators are offering to engage students related to their questions on federal actions during general meetings of the Undergraduate Council of Students, Graduate Student Council and Medical Student Senate. Discussions are ongoing with the student leaders of those organizations to arrange scheduling.\n\nWe remain vigilant in reviewing all new federal guidance and announcements, including recent Executive Orders and the U.S. Department of Education's Feb. 14 Dear Colleague letter on the prohibitions against discrimination based on race, color, and national origin applicable to schools and other entities receiving federal financial assistance. In addition to ongoing questions about research funding, immigration, and residency status for international members of our community, we understand that many members of our community hope to learn about any implications of this latest federal announcement for Brown.\n\nIn an environment of such pervasive uncertainty, we will not be able to offer definitive responses on many emerging questions, but we want to assure our community that the University continues to comply with applicable law and policy while remaining committed to efforts to foster a strong academic community through initiatives that aim to help all faculty, students and staff thrive, feel welcome, and participate fully in the life of the University. We continue to remind departments and offices to avoid taking independent or pre-emptive actions regarding Brown programs or websites without consulting with their academic dean or vice president overseeing their administrative area.\n\nA University working group continues to closely assess the statements coming out of Washington, D.C., consulting with educational associations and policy experts to understand updates and/or ongoing challenges to emerging federal announcements with negative impacts for higher education. This has included Brown's support for legal challenges to safeguard federal research funding, as announced earlier this month.\n\nRegistering for Town Halls\n\nRegistration information for the Feb. 26 town hall and other town halls and listening sessions will appear in the calendar announcements or email invitations for those events, including details about the intended participants (whether the event is for staff only, students only, members of a division or school community, etc.). Please regularly consult the University's events calendar at events.brown.edu to make arrangements to attend.\n\nTo promote open dialogue in a trusted environment, all town halls are subject to the Chatham House rule: While participants are free to use the information received in the session, comments should not be attributed to any speaker. With the same goal, only designated participants may attend, reporters cannot participate, and recording is strictly prohibited.\n\nThe Feb. 26 staff town hall will provide an opportunity for staff to ask senior representatives of the administration about a broad range of concerns related to the impact of recent federal actions on Brown and higher education.\n\nPanelists will include President Christina H. Paxson, Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration Sarah Latham, and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Sandhya Iyer, while other administrators will also be present. This event is open only to current Brown staff.\n\nWe look forward to opportunities to reinforce Brown's commitment to our mission of education and research.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J.

    "content": "Brown has joined a federal lawsuit as a named plaintiff and member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) challenging the action announced February 7, 2025, by the National Institutes of Health limiting Facilities and Administrative (F&A) reimbursements to a 15% rate for the agency’s research grants.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed jointly on the evening of February 10 by the AAU, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), the American Council on Education (ACE), and a number of public and private research universities facing irreparable harm from NIH's action. This lawsuit follows immediately after Brown submitted a declaration supporting a separate legal action filed Monday by almost two dozen state attorneys general to immediately halt the implementation of the 15% cap.\n\nIn our communication to the campus yesterday, President Paxson and I indicated that we continued to partner with our educational associations on a response. This lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts is the outcome of those discussions. In our campus message and the accompanying news item, we shared the direct implications to Brown of the significant threats to funding that provides critical support for high-impact research in medicine and health.\n\nHere, I am sharing the joint public statement from Brown and the other plaintiffs in this case:\n\nStatement Regarding the Legal Challenge to the Cuts to NIH Research Funding\n\nOn Friday, February 7, 2025, the administration declared that it would cut funding for life-saving medical research. Its announcement that it would limit Facilities and Administrative (F&A) reimbursements to a 15% rate for all NIH research grants would have an immediate and dire impact on critical biomedical and health research nationwide. F&A costs are the real and necessary costs of conducting the groundbreaking research that has led to so many medical breakthroughs over the past decades. A cut to F&A for NIH grants is a cut to the medical research that helps countless American families whose loved ones face incurable diseases or untreatable debilitating conditions.\n\nBesides harming the ability of research universities to continue doing critical NIH research that seeks out new and more effective approaches to treating cancer, heart disease, and dementia, among others, and translating basic science into cures, this cut would also undermine universities’ essential training of the next generation of biomedical and health science researchers. The loss of this American workforce pipeline would be a blow to the U.S. economy, to American science and innovation, to patients and their families, and to our nation’s position in the world as a leader in medical research.\n\nIt would be, quite simply, a self-inflicted wound.\n\nToday, February 10, 2025, we have jointly filed suit in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, along with a number of impacted research university co-plaintiffs, seeking to halt the proposed cut. Besides its devastating impact on medical research and training, the proposed actions run afoul of the longstanding regulatory frameworks governing federal grants and foundational principles of administrative law. Judicial relief is amply justified and urgently needed. This action is ill-conceived and self-defeating for both America’s patients and their families as well as the nation as a whole. We look forward to presenting our case in court.",

    "content": "It gives me great pleasure to announce the appointment of Greg Hirth, Professor of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, as Brown’s next Vice President for Research. Greg has been serving in the role on an interim basis for the past few months, and I’m delighted to formalize his appointment in this important leadership position.\n\nUnder Greg’s direction since October, the Division of Research has seen a record number of submissions to the University’s internal SEED and Salomon grant programs – leveraging new funds for research in the humanities and humanistic social sciences – and continues its stewardship of Brown’s annual $300 million in federal research operations. Over the past two weeks, Greg has been instrumental in helping Brown researchers navigate grant submission guidelines and new directives from federal agencies in the wake of the new presidential administration.\n\nAs vice president for research, Greg will continue to advance Brown’s mission and impact by supporting faculty and students in all aspects of their research activities – from the conception of new ideas through the dissemination of the knowledge they create. Identifying the highest research needs of faculty across the University, Greg serves as a strong advocate for their support, and collaborates with senior academic and administrative leaders on research initiatives and policy development. Working closely with Deputy Vice President for Research Marty Scholtz, Greg will lead research operations and drive major, multi-phase initiatives in the research space.\n\nThroughout his time leading the Division of Research, Greg has contributed a wealth of expertise to Brown’s research enterprise. He is recognized internationally for his groundbreaking work in tectonophysics, a field of geophysics that studies the movement of the Earth's crustal plates, the formation of mountains and earthquakes, and other tectonic phenomena. Greg has led research teams that have significantly advanced our understanding of deep-earth earthquakes and the processes driving the formation and deformation of lithospheric plates.\n\nAs I noted when he was named interim vice president for research, Greg was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences last year, two of the highest honors a scholar can achieve. In recognition of his contributions, he has also received the prestigious George P. Woollard Award from the Geological Society of America, among numerous other accolades. Beyond his academic achievements, Greg has demonstrated leadership within the American Geophysical Union and served as chair of the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences.\n\nGreg earned his bachelor’s degree in geological sciences from Indiana University, followed by master's and doctoral degrees in geological sciences from Brown.\n\nI look forward to continuing to work closely with Greg and to collaborating with him and the entire Division of Research staff to support Brown’s ambitious research goals.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle\n\nProvost",

    "content": "We are writing to share an update regarding the Brown/Trinity MFA programs in acting and directing, for which new student admissions have been paused since 2023.\n\nAs you may know, in 2002, Brown University and Trinity Repertory Company partnered to create the MFA programs in acting and directing. This innovative collaboration has helped to launch some of the finest and most accomplished artists on the American theatre scene. As the field has evolved, leaders at Brown and Trinity Rep determined that our current training model needed to be re-examined to adapt to changing conditions. As a result, in 2023, Brown and Trinity announced a pause in admissions to the program to begin the process of re-examination.\n\nOver the past 18 months, based on extensive analysis by and discussion among leaders at Brown and Trinity, and insights from a review of the programs by external experts, it has become clear that this important conversation needs a deeper examination as we try to understand the emerging needs of the field and the most effective education and training in a new context.\n\nWith that in mind, Brown University and Trinity Repertory Company have decided to indefinitely pause admissions for the Brown/Trinity MFA programs. While there may come a time in which we create and implement a new academic model for the programs, that will not come in the short term. The programs will continue to operate until June 2026, with two classes of students remaining enrolled through the conclusion of this academic year, and with one class of students for next academic year.\n\nWhile leaders from both Brown and Trinity are fully committed to supporting all currently enrolled students through the culmination of their studies — and the programs will remain fully operational and supported while the two currently enrolled cohorts’ experiences are complete — we recognize that many people affiliated with the programs will be disappointed. Please know that this decision comes after a deep and thoughtful review. The leaders of both institutions see this as a natural and significant evolution of the relationship between Brown and Trinity, and we continue to be mutually committed to the performing arts and to one another, and poised to move forward on a path toward new partnership and collaboration.\n\nNext Steps in the Brown / Trinity Relationship\n\nTo consider what the years ahead may look like, two groups of partners will help chart the shared future for our organizations. At Brown, a new working group led by the faculty director of the Brown Arts Institute, Sydney Skybetter, will lead a process to envision the future of professional performing arts training in the context of a research university. This group will include leaders from Trinity Rep and the Brown Arts Institute, along with professionals working in the field, Brown faculty, Brown alumni and especially alumni of the Brown/Trinity programs. The working group will be charged with examining trends, convening discussions to explore the future of the live arts, and proposing professional development models through which Brown and Trinity Rep can partner.\n\nAdditionally, leaders at Trinity Rep will be working with members of the Brown faculty and administration to determine a path forward for our two institutions’ fiscal and facilities partnerships, and future community and university collaborations. We already work together on projects and initiatives well beyond our joint MFA programs, and we look forward to doing so in new and expanded ways in the years ahead.\n\nTrinity Rep, Brown and the dedicated faculty and staff who have led the MFA programs in acting and directing continue to be deeply committed to supporting all students who are enrolled in the program and to considering new and innovative ways to educate artists and theatrical performers. This change in our partnership does not diminish that commitment. We look forward to collaborating with students, alumni, artists, teachers and others in reimagining the future of partnership for Brown and Trinity Rep.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJayna Brown\n\nChair of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies\n\nBrown University\n\nCurt Columbus\n\nArtistic Director\n\nTrinity Repertory Company\n\nFrancis J.

    "content": "I write to share that after a successful decade-long tenure at Brown, Shankar Prasad, dean of the School of Professional Studies since 2022, will step down effective Jan. 31 to join the senior leadership team at Carnegie, a higher education marketing and enrollment strategy firm, as chief strategy officer. Shankar, a Brown Ph.D. alumnus, will depart after 10 years at Brown that also included appointments as deputy provost, vice president for academic innovation, and associate director of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. He has been instrumental in building on the University’s academic strengths, delivering instruction in compelling new ways and making Brown’s world-class education accessible to a diverse range of learners across the globe.\n\nAs the third dean of SPS and Brown’s first vice president for academic innovation, Shankar provided executive oversight of the school’s academic programs, finance and administrative operations, and student life, and worked with academic leaders across campus to develop new areas for growth and success. He managed a growing portfolio of master’s degree and professional programs and created initiatives to reach learners across the globe through digital education platforms, including partnering with the School of Public Health to launch an online master of public health program, Brown’s first exclusively online degree program.\n\nWith a focus on meeting the needs of diverse learners at various stages of their careers, Shankar led the expansion of Brown’s suite of non-degree programs, including corporate education programs, certificate programs and short courses that focus on rapid skill development. Additional initiatives launched under his leadership have focused on increased outreach to Brown alumni to promote learning opportunities, and wider access for University staff members to enroll in SPS professional programs. He led an expansion in support for master’s students on campus, including through the launch of a Center for Master’s Student Excellence. To cultivate a campus-wide approach to strengthened support for master’s students, he focused on building strong collaborations with key units across Brown, including Campus Life, Global Brown and the Graduate School.\n\nIn a series of leadership roles in the Office of the Provost from 2016 to 2022, Shankar worked closely with Brown leaders to advance academic excellence, improve operational effectiveness and financial sustainability, and promote community through a range of priorities and initiatives. Among other efforts, he played important roles in academic continuity and return-to-campus planning during the COVID-19 pandemic, strategic planning and reorganizations for multiple Brown schools, institutes and centers, and the transition of the Brown Arts Initiative to the expanded Brown Arts Institute.\n\nWith a longstanding focus on cultivating a diverse and inclusive community, Shankar also played a key role in advancing campus engagement efforts to support the development of Brown’s Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan (DIAP) in 2016, was a member of Brown’s Diversity and Inclusion Oversight Board and served in governance and advisory roles for the Leadership Alliance and the Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative at Brown. He wrote the University’s first global strategy for advancing research, teaching and learning around the world, working simultaneously to create an inclusive community for international students, staff and faculty on campus. In recognition of those efforts, the launch of the Global Brown lounge and the expansion of the Office of International Student and Scholar Services, Brown was awarded a Senator Paul Simon Award for Campus Internalization in 2019.\n\nIn assuming the role of chief strategy officer for Carnegie, a leader in higher education marketing and enrollment strategy, Shankar will be responsible for overall enterprise strategy and will oversee student search and success and presidential advisory offerings for the company. He leaves Brown with a long and successful track record of leadership and innovation, and a lasting impact on priorities ranging from online education and new academic programs to global engagement and support for graduate students on campus. I hope you’ll join me in celebrating his impact at Brown and wishing him well in his new role at Carnegie.\n\nGrowth in Brown’s suite of master’s programs remains an important priority for the University, and we will share plans for a national search for a new SPS dean in the coming weeks. Sandra Smith, senior associate dean for professional and executive education at the School of Professional Studies, will serve as the school’s interim dean upon Shankar’s departure at the end of the month, and I appreciate her commitment to taking on this important role.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J.

    "content": "March 25, 2025\n\nLast week, we learned through various news outlets that the Trump Administration was expected to suspend $175M in federal contracts awarded to Penn, citing the participation of a transgender athlete on the women’s swimming team in 2022. Previously, on February 6, 2025, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) notified Penn that it had initiated a directed investigation under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination, into the University’s intercollegiate athletics participation policies.\n\nI write today to provide an update on these two important and related matters.\n\nFor NCAA Division I sports, eligibility is governed by NCAA rules. Beginning in 2010, the NCAA required that transgender student-athletes be permitted to participate on college teams. Penn has never had a transgender student-athlete policy of its own. During the 2021-22 season, a student-athlete who had transitioned while on leave from Penn the previous year competed in women’s swimming, in full compliance with NCAA rules and Title IX policies in place at the time.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, the current administration released an executive order, “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports.” The following day, the NCAA revised its policy in compliance with the executive order, as did our conference. On February 13, 2025, OCR sought information from Penn in connection with its investigation in response to the “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports” executive order. In our response, we affirmed that during the 2021-2022 season, we followed NCAA rules and applicable law as they existed then, and that we now comply with the NCAA policy and the law as they exist today. We expect to continue to engage with OCR, vigorously defending our position.\n\nDespite this, faculty across seven different schools received stop work orders last week on federally contracted research, amounting to approximately $175M. These contracts include research on preventing hospital-acquired infections, drug screening against deadly viruses, quantum computing, protections against chemical warfare, and student loan programs. These stop work orders are in addition to several federal grants that have been cancelled recently, and the slowing down of the award of grants going forward. We are actively pursuing multiple avenues to understand and address these funding terminations, freezes, and slowdowns.\n\nFederal funding freezes and cancellations jeopardize lifesaving and life-improving research, the loss of which will be felt by society and individuals far beyond our campus for years to come. Understandably, we are hearing concerns not only from scientists affected directly, but more broadly from students and young faculty embarking on careers in research.\n\nWe value the long-standing partnership with the federal government to carry out research that makes America stronger and healthier. Robust federal research support for more than 75 years has made America’s higher education system the envy of the world. I hope we can restore trust and refocus on creativity, innovation, and training.\n\nI encourage the Penn community to visit our Federal Government Updates webpage for additional information and resources on a range of issues. Stay informed, support one another, and continue all the excellent work you are doing in support of Penn’s missions.\n\nJ. Larry Jameson, MD, Ph.D., President",

    "content": "March 13, 2025\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania today voted unanimously to appoint J. Larry Jameson, who has served as Interim President since December 2023, President of the University for a term that will run through June 30, 2027.\n\nIn announcing the appointment, Chair of the Board of Trustees Ramanan Raghavendran stated, “The challenges facing higher education today are among the most significant ever encountered by American universities. Given Penn’s complexity, size, location, and visibility, these issues have profound implications for our community.”\n\n“In such a moment, there is nothing more important than leadership.”\n\n“Penn has been very fortunate to have Larry Jameson at the helm during this time. I am pleased that our Board can recognize his exceptional performance, and acknowledge his inspirational leadership and vision, by formally extending his appointment to June 30, 2027.”\n\nBefore his appointment as Interim President in December 2023, Jameson served as Executive Vice President of the University of Pennsylvania for the Health System and as Dean of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine since July 1, 2011.\n\nIn accepting the Board’s appointment, Jameson stated, “I am profoundly honored by this vote of confidence from our Board of Trustees. I look forward to continuing the vital work of our faculty, staff, students, alumni, and community members to uphold Penn’s mission of utilizing knowledge for the greater good. I am confident that our University's future is bright as we prioritize our core values of excellence, freedom of inquiry and expression, and respect. I am deeply committed to this extraordinary institution, and it is an honor to serve as Penn’s President.”\n\nBefore joining Penn Medicine, Jameson served for four years as Dean of the Feinberg School of Medicine and Vice President of Medical Affairs at Northwestern University. He first joined Northwestern University Medical School in 1993, as Chief of the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Molecular Medicine. In 2000, he was named Irving S. Cutter Professor of Medicine and Chair of the Department of Medicine.\n\nJameson received his medical degree with honors and a doctoral degree in biochemistry from the University of North Carolina in 1981. He completed clinical training in internal medicine and endocrinology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Before leaving for Northwestern University, he rose through the ranks at Harvard Medical School to become an associate professor of medicine and chief of the Thyroid Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nAn accomplished physician-scientist, Jameson has pioneered studies of the genetic basis of hormonal disorders, and he is the author of more than 350 scientific articles and chapters. He is an editor of “Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine,” the most widely used textbook of internal medicine. His research has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including The New England Journal of Medicine, Nature Genetics, Science, and the Journal of Clinical Investigation. He has served as president of The Endocrine Society and Association of American Physicians, and recently chaired the Board of Directors of the American Association of Medical Colleges. Jameson has received many distinguished awards, including the Van Meter Award from the American Thyroid Association, the Koch Award from The Endocrine Society, and the Sheen Award from the American College of Surgeons. Jameson is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine.\n\nAs Interim President, Dr. Jameson has championed Penn’s values, helped define the University’s position on academic independence and institutional neutrality, and led the implementation of its strategic framework, In Principle and Practice. Early milestones include the dedication of Penn’s new home for interdisciplinary data science; Draw Down the Lightning Grants to fund projects that accelerate progress on Penn’s priorities; Penn Washington, the University’s hub for civic engagement and policy in the nation’s capital; inaugural leadership roles to advance the University’s work and expertise in climate science and the arts; advances in Penn’s commitment to sustainability; and pioneering academic programs and initiatives, including the Ivy League’s first undergraduate degree program in AI. Jameson also leads Penn’s efforts to combat bias, build community, and balance the University’s strong commitment to open expression and mutual respect, which includes the launch of Penn’s Office of Religious and Ethnic Interests (Title VI), the first of its kind nationally.\n\n##",

    "content": "I know our community is closely following the flurry of recent Executive Orders, federal guidance, and legal actions, especially as they affect higher education, diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, research programs, funding, and immigration. Penn has always upheld the law, and we will continue doing so. But the future of higher education may alter dramatically depending on how courts rule, how agencies implement new policies, and how future orders and legislation are enacted.\n\nThe anxiety and frustration many people feel at this moment is deep and often quite personal. I understand. But what has changed so rapidly is not the value, rightness, and impact of Penn’s contributions and promise. What has changed is the increasing polarization in public opinion about higher education and the accompanying changes in federal guidance and oversight. Penn must both respond and adapt to this rapidly shifting landscape.\n\nI have heard from many that while we must remain agile, we must foremost protect Penn’s soul. I passionately agree and reaffirm Penn’s enduring values and principles. Among these are:\n\nOur essential missions : Everything we do must be grounded in advancing Penn’s world-class teaching, research, clinical care, and service. This focus is especially important in times of turbulence and uncertainty.\n\n: Everything we do must be grounded in advancing Penn’s world-class teaching, research, clinical care, and service. This focus is especially important in times of turbulence and uncertainty. Academic freedom : Everything we do must support freedom of inquiry and thought, open expression, and the rigorous pursuit of truth. These elements are essential to how we contribute to the world.\n\n: Everything we do must support freedom of inquiry and thought, open expression, and the rigorous pursuit of truth. These elements are essential to how we contribute to the world. Opportunity, access, and support: Everything we do must be anchored in principled non-discrimination, expanding access, and embracing diversity in all its forms – all while following the law, which we will continue doing. These commitments to our culture have made Penn a pioneer in higher education for more than a century. We are stronger for it. A commitment to inclusive excellence has advanced research, scholarship, and patient care in profound ways.\n\nAs I communicated on February 11, cuts to federal funding loom, from financial aid to research funds, and proposed legislation to increase endowment taxes. These elements, along with changing rules related to cultural norms of higher education, are among the most significant of our challenges and represent an existential threat across our University and American higher education.\n\nWe are acting to protect our missions, our operations, our people, and our values. Here’s what the Penn community should know right now about what we are doing:\n\nVigorous advocacy : Penn’s leadership is directly engaged with our elected officials to ensure that Penn’s mission is preserved. We have also partnered with the Association of American Universities, the American Association of Medical Colleges, and other professional organizations, to advocate for the essential role of higher education, scientific discovery, our values, and our service to the greater good.\n\nInternal response : In my February 11 message , I noted that we have convened a pan-University working group in seven different priority areas, all focused on evaluating the impact of new federal policies and actions on our academic and research enterprise. Led by Provost John L. Jackson Jr., Senior Executive Vice President Craig Carnaroli, and Senior Vice President David Asch, this group is focused on ensuring internal coordination, planning, and efficient decision-making in this rapidly changing environment.\n\nContingency planning: We are modeling different financial scenarios and actions that may need to be implemented, and we are working closely with school and center leaders to seek input and ideas around possible cost containment measures and new sources of revenue. The multiple challenges we face remind us that we are all in this together. As has been our approach in past situations, we will remain judicious, measured, deliberate, and focused on sustaining our mission when determining any action.\n\nHere is what I ask of you, the Penn community:\n\nRemain united : Perhaps the most important factor for success, especially in tumultuous times, is our unity of purpose and support for one another. In the face of profound societal and governmental forces, Penn’s future depends not just on the resilience of the individuals in our community, but also on our mutual respect and shared support.\n\nTake care of yourselves : Penn offers a range of services to help support you. Below this message, you’ll find a list of several critical resources, and I encourage you to make use of what you may need. I also encourage you to provide support to your local community – people you are closest to in your schools, departments, centers, and social groups.\n\nBe ambassadors for Penn and higher education: We are a broad community of students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty, staff, alumni, parents, and friends. Penn has connected us and touched us and the world. Amazing things happen at Penn on a daily basis and even more so over time. We are all ambassadors through our messages, scholarship, service, and actions. Through your many networks and professional organizations, I encourage you to convey the value that Penn, and higher education, brings to individuals and society more broadly.\n\nAs the world around us changes, we will adapt and engage to shape the future. We are not strangers to challenge – Penn has endured wars and pandemics over its long history. Today’s challenges are profound and multimodal, and they will test us. We are resourced and inspired by a community that loves Penn, and that pursues its future with idealism and pragmatism, courage and compromise. These characteristics, and our enduring principles, have served us well and will continue to guide our future.\n\nJ. Larry Jameson, MD, Ph.D., Interim President\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nA List of Resources for the Penn Community\n\nPenn has a robust network of campus resources for students, faculty, and staff impacted by events on and off campus that can be accessed here.

    "content": "As you are likely aware, Friday evening we received news of an unprecedented action from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that they will immediately be capping the Facilities & Administration (F&A) rates on research grants to universities at 15%. This announcement understandably has raised many questions and concerns. Please know that we are working to identify solutions to minimize the impact on faculty and staff, and the important research and clinical trials currently underway at Penn.\n\nThis is not simply an accounting change; it is far more serious with significant implications for Penn’s research programs. On NIH grants, the actions announced this past week would reduce annual federal funding to Penn by approximately $240 million. If other federal agencies were to adopt the same formula, the loss to Penn would reach $315 million. The effect of this sudden and major change in research support will be to severely harm our highly impactful research mission.\n\nNIH-funded research at Penn has enriched the world in innumerable and lifesaving ways, whether combatting cancer with CAR T therapy; developing vaccines with mRNA technology; creating gene editing tools and advancing gene therapy cures; developing drugs that treat a range of maladies, including those that combat macular degeneration and rare forms of congenital blindness—the list is long and powerful in its impact. The reduction in funds announced by the federal government would blunt this critical, lifesaving work.\n\nConducting academic research incurs significant infrastructure costs—such as construction of specialized labs, utilities costs, technical equipment, and regulatory compliance. These F&A rates, sometimes referred to as indirect costs, have been carefully negotiated for decades using a rigorous review process. Even at the current rate of 62.5%, government funding covers only about half of these infrastructure costs. The historic model has been one of partnership between academic institutions and the federal government, and it is arguably a major reason the U.S. is the leader in biomedical research and the envy of the world.\n\nThese cuts by NIH will affect universities across the country, and we continue to explore legal options to address these reductions. Among our actions, and we are working with the Association of American Universities (AAU), which represents the 71 largest research universities, both public and private, to reach out to lawmakers to explain the impact this decision will have for research, patients, and the economy. Importantly, AAU filed a motion in federal court for a restraining order to block the implementation of the cuts. Penn, along with a number of other universities joined the AAU in filing this action.\n\nIn addition to our work with AAU and other higher education associations, we have formed a planning group internally to address the many changes coming out of Washington.\n\nWe understand that the consequences of the actions being taken by NIH are significant, and if allowed to stand, will require us to work together to implement necessary cost saving measures. We are actively working with the leadership in each of our schools to model the potential impact of these funding cuts and will keep our community apprised of major developments and actions that need to be taken. While we don’t yet know how these administrative and judicial actions will evolve, I want to emphasize that Penn has long been a leader in research, resilience, and adaptation. Our community is strong, and we will continue our groundbreaking research, advocate forcefully, and take the steps needed to sustain our mission.\n\nJ. Larry Jameson, MD, Ph.D., Interim President",

These include executive orders and pending legislation on research funding, financial aid, visas, immigration status, student loans, endowments, and DEI programs. Because these immediately affect our missions, operations, and community, I write today to provide guidance to sustain our missions while ensuring Penn complies with federal law.\n\n\n\nFirst, we do not know how these developments will play out. We have convened members of Penn’s administration, the Faculty Senate, the Council of Deans, and other leaders to review these orders, understand their implications, and ensure that we are taking appropriate action. Given the rapidly changing landscape, we are also reviewing our policies, programs, and practices.\n\n\n\nSecond, Penn’s financial outlook is sound, and the Penn community should continue its essential research and other work. We know these announcements from Washington have caused uncertainty and anxiety. If you have questions or if your funding agency has specifically requested that you pause your research, please get in touch with your Dean’s office.\n\n\n\nThird, we will uphold Penn’s values. Our values, like our University motto, have served Penn well for centuries and through many societal shifts. Our success as a world-class academic institution is inextricably linked to our commitment to non-discrimination and prizing excellence. This approach guides how we identify and recruit the most talented individuals based on their accomplishments and potential. In my meetings with faculty, students, and alumni, I never cease to be amazed by the brilliant and aspirational people at Penn and by the impact that we are having on the world.\n\n\n\nThe American higher education system is the envy of the world and one of America’s greatest strengths. A social contract has long enabled U.S. colleges and universities to serve individuals, communities, and government for the good of all. This contract has been a cornerstone of innovation and opportunity in our society.\n\n\n\nI ask every member of the Penn community to come together and do what we must: take care of one another, seek help when needed, and ensure the continuation of our critically important work. Together, we will protect and preserve what defines us as Penn.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJ. Larry Jameson, MD, Ph.D.\n\nInterim President",

    "content": "As we embark on 2025, I’ve been reflecting on humanity’s and Penn’s immense progress over the past quarter century. We have witnessed dramatic additions to the buildings on our campus as well as Penn Park, enhanced need-blind financial aid and access, most recently through the Quaker Commitment, and emerged as a leader in innovation in multiple fields.\n\nThere have also been enormous challenges—some old and some new—and it is understandable if people feel anxious about the future. In Principle and Practice identifies grand challenges like climate and sustainability and the impact of AI on every aspect of our lives. I am optimistic that Penn will play a major role in tackling these challenges.\n\nHowever, we also face a challenge closer to home: many people are questioning the value and role of higher education in society. This phenomenon did not develop overnight or in a vacuum. Globally, public confidence in all sorts of institutions has diminished. While it is tempting to be defensive, it is more constructive to listen to criticisms, be reflective, and chart a course that will restore trust and support and advance our missions.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to address this very subject, and I maintain that the work of excellent universities like ours has never been more valuable or critical to society’s advance. Penn contributes in three important ways.\n\nWe fuel individual success. As exemplified by the Penn experience of our newest Rhodes Scholar, excellent universities help students find their purpose and prepare them for a richly fulfilled and fulfilling life. The lifelong return on investment for individuals, families, and their communities is significant and well-documented.\n\nWe drive societal progress. Excellent universities are repositories of humanity’s knowledge. We support the world’s great scholars, researchers, and clinicians. In the best tradition of Franklin, these creative minds expand the frontiers of human understanding. So often, it is the genius, breakthroughs, and Nobel-worthy leaps forward from excellent universities that transform our world.\n\nWe work to ensure that humanity and the planet thrive. The knowledge we create reaches every part of the globe. Each year, thousands of students and faculty participate in academic exchanges around the world. As noted above, in our strategic planning for the future, we have identified some of the great challenges of our age. These require solutions and knowledge that do not come from any single field, but from many. Penn is investing broadly, building innovatively, and marshaling the best of our interdisciplinary strength for broad impact.\n\nThat’s not to say we cannot do better. As we assert in our University values, we are imperfect but always self-improving. But I believe that higher education remains one of the most powerful drivers of society’s evolution and success.\n\nAs we return to campus and to class, I encourage you to see and celebrate all the essential ways you contribute to Penn’s academic missions. Never doubt that your learning, teaching, research, care, and service together compose a powerful force for good in the world.\n\nI hope you enjoyed a restful and relaxing winter break, and I look forward to everything we will achieve in the semester ahead. Welcome to a new year at Penn.",

This meeting will focus on updates from the board meetings, including budget discussions and ongoing work.\n\nFaculty and staff may join in person or sign up for a Zoom link to participate. We will provide the latest information at the upcoming meeting. Please note that Zoom participants will be able to listen but will not be able to interact with the speakers during the meeting (a similar approach to Vermont faculty meetings). As a reminder, all previous budget updates are posted on the Middlebury website.\n\nWe also will be scheduling a town hall meeting at the Middlebury Institute after MIIS Commencement and will give an update on the Board meeting and the business plan goals at that time.\n\nBelow are some additional resources and updates:\n\nVoluntary Staff Retirement Program\n\nEmployees who expressed interest and are eligible for the voluntary staff retirement program received individualized agreements during the past week. We encourage any applicants to contact the Human Resources team with questions. We will be sharing information with those who have received agreements and will offer additional information sessions. Final signed agreements need to be returned within 45 days. In mid-May, we’ll share information with supervisors about vacancies created by voluntary retirements and how those open positions will be considered. Final information about departures and retirement dates will be shared with supervisors in June.\n\nTIAA Representative on Campus\n\nA TIAA representative will be on campus every Wednesday in May and June to consult on retirement contributions and planning. All sessions will be at the Office of Human Resources at 75 Shannon Street. You can sign up for in-person or virtual consultations here (TIAA login required).\n\nHealth Benefits Discussion\n\nWe will continue our discussions with the Faculty and Staff Resources Committees about options and approaches to health plans through the spring and into summer and will provide updates once that work is complete.\n\nSharing Ideas\n\nFaculty and staff are welcome to submit additional Budget or Structural Change Ideas. We continue to review these submissions and evaluate feasibility of these ideas.\n\nFAQs\n\nAs a reminder, you may check our Frequently Asked Questions for additional information.\n\nThank you for engaging in this process. We look forward to seeing you Wednesday.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Snyder\n\nInterim President\n\n\n\nMichelle McCauley\n\nExecutive Vice President and Provost\n\nDavid Provost\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",

    "content": "This year, Middlebury received a total of 11,831 applications for the Class of 2029 and 2029.5 with a record high number of international students in the pool. Acceptances were sent to 13.9 percent of the applicant pool.\n\nIn March, 1,136 students were admitted through the Regular Decision round. They joined 519 students admitted through the Early Decision 1 and Early Decision 2 rounds, which included scholars identified through college access partnerships with QuestBridge, Posse, and College Track.\n\n“The Admissions Committee reviewed every submitted application from a highly qualified group of students who have demonstrated their rigorous academic preparation, personal fortitude, and deep curiosity for ideas. They are ready to join Middlebury’s dynamic global community,” said Nicole Curvin, vice president for strategic enrollment and dean of admissions.\n\nThroughout the month of April, Middlebury Admissions welcomed hundreds of admitted students and their families for Preview Days programming including class and dining hall visits, tours, and special programming that highlighted distinctive campus experiences. Admitted students met with faculty, staff and students to experience all that Middlebury offers. There were also virtual events providing a flexible way for admitted students to connect with each other and to the rest of the Middlebury community.\n\nMiddlebury is in the fifth year of a test optional pilot policy, with 44 percent of those admitted this year opting to forgo sharing test scores, demonstrating their potential in other ways. In June 2023, the college extended the test optional pilot program for three years (up to the entering Class of 2030). The college collects standardized testing information upon enrollment and continues to review and evaluate student progress throughout their time at Middlebury.\n\nAmong the highlights of the Class of 2029 and Class of 2029.5 admitted class:\n\n1,112 high schools are represented from around the world\n\n95 languages are spoken\n\n73 countries are represented\n\n49 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are represented\n\n18 percent are first generation\n\n$19.7 million of financial aid will be awarded\n\nMiddlebury meets the full demonstrated need of all admitted students and is committed to providing access through a variety of resources to academic, social and pre-professional opportunities. Student Financial Services provides additional resources to some students, including a laptop, health insurance and class materials and/or books.\n\nStudents will notify Middlebury of their plans by May 1 and 640 students are expected in September and 115 students in February.",

    "content": "Josiah Durfee ’25 has been awarded a fellowship from the Saint Andrew’s Society of New York to pursue a Master of Letters (MLitt) in strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThe award, given annually to promote cultural interchange and good will between Scotland and the United States, covers the cost of tuition, fees, and transportation for a year of graduate study in Scotland. Durfee, a political science major with a minor in geography, plans to study security strategy for two semesters starting in September 2025, followed by an independent dissertation over the summer.\n\n“I will be able to study security strategy during a particularly unstable international environment with some of the best experts in a small town setting similar to Middlebury,” said Durfee. “I’m particularly excited to work with Professor Phillips O’Brien, an expert on the Ukraine war, which was the subject of my senior thesis.”\n\nDurfee said Scotland’s history provides a unique setting for studying strategy. “Its history is defined by years of conquest, religious conflict, ethnic turnover, and rebellion, many of which are physically reflected in the landscape,” he said. “Learning there can be supplemented by visiting castles, battlefields, and other strategic sites dotting the country.”\n\nBefore starting his graduate work, Durfee plans to work for a think tank conducting open-source intelligence research on the war in Ukraine. After studying at St Andrews, Scotland’s oldest university founded in 1413, he hopes to work in a federal or international policy position focusing on transatlantic security.\n\nFounded in 1756, the Saint Andrew’s Society of the State of New York provides charitable relief, academic opportunities, and fosters fellowship around a common Scottish heritage.",

    "content": "Middlebury leadership sent the following message to the campus community on Friday, April 25.\n\nTo Our Community,\n\nWe write today with an update on our efforts to reduce Middlebury’s structural deficit, which we described in an April 2 letter and followed up on in written communications and in-person meetings with faculty and staff—to discuss specifics, answer questions, and address concerns.\n\nOver the past three weeks we’ve continued our close consultations with select committees of the Board of Trustees, which has ultimate responsibility for Middlebury’s fiscal health and which charged our administration with creating and delivering a plan to get us to a long-term, sustainable financial position. The board continues to support our plan.\n\nWe’ve also been briefing incoming president Ian Baucom throughout this process. In his letter sent yesterday, Ian expressed full support of this work, of “the truly difficult financial decisions affecting the College.” As Ian acknowledged, “their cost is real, they affect real lives, but I firmly believe that they come from a deep loyalty to the institution, a sincere desire to avoid the greater human pain of significant layoffs, stabilize a budget in structural deficit, safeguard us as best as possible from the financial threats of this moment, and secure a route to our future.”\n\nA Mandate to Balance the Budget\n\nThe decisions we’ve made to respond to the board’s mandate for a balanced budget have been guided from the beginning by a number of principles consistent with our values as an institution. We have proposed structural changes that are designed to bring Middlebury’s operations in line with our peers, who do not report ongoing budget deficits, while protecting the student experience and creating the least possible impact on our community.\n\nAs we did in the economic downturn of 2009 and again during the COVID pandemic, we have prioritized the jobs of our staff and are choosing the steps we’ve outlined in lieu of the freezes and widespread layoffs that have begun at other institutions. We understand that the decisions we’ve made create hardship for many of our longest-serving colleagues, but we believe that the change in retirement contribution creates a more equitable system for all our employees, even as it preserves Middlebury’s retirement program as one of the most generous among our peer institutions.\n\nFinally, we understand concerns among colleagues about a perceived lack of consultation about our budget challenges and these decisions. We hope our work over many years with the Faculty Council, Staff Council, and Faculty Resources Committee, among others, represents a consistent effort to provide the greatest possible transparency. However, as senior leadership we’re charged by the board—and accountable to the institution—for ultimately deciding on the course of action.\n\nThose are the issues and considerations that have motivated us from the start.\n\nIn this letter we want to do two things. First, we’ll provide more context based on the discussions we’ve had with various constituent groups around the institution and the feedback we’ve received—which includes the Motion and Rationale sponsored by the AAUP Executive Committee and Faculty Council, and The Middlebury Campus opinion piece authored last week by senior economics faculty. We hear you, and we’ll continue to listen and engage throughout this process. Second, we want to let you know about upcoming information sessions and resources.\n\nMore Context and Answers\n\nThe following questions and answers come directly from our discussions in the community. We thought it would be most useful to include them here.\n\n— Why did we just borrow $45 million? We did it to fund the accumulated deficits we’ve incurred over the last five years. This means we simply have no financial flexibility in our budget and can’t pull those dollars from the endowment because the bulk of it is restricted by contracts with donors to fund specific purposes. In addition, the cost of borrowing money is less than the return we receive from preserving the endowment. Our rate was 4.66 percent on the recent borrowing, whereas our average 10-year return on the endowment is 8.7 percent. This is important for the financial sustainability of Middlebury.\n\n— We will have financial flexibility if we can achieve a few consecutive years of balanced budgets or even modest surpluses. If we can get to that point, our first priority will be faculty salaries given that we’ve brought staff to market over the last few years.\n\n— The board is keenly focused on Middlebury’s long-term health and concerned that the current economic and political environment might worsen. How do we not only defend but enhance our cherished institution? What difficult decisions must we make now and in the future to ensure our viability? Those questions are front and center, and contingency planning will be a must in addition to current plans.\n\n— The financial position of MIIS is of great concern and we’re closely monitoring the current headwinds out of Washington. We made major changes over the last year including sunsetting multiple programs and letting many colleagues go. These changes included a four-year timeframe with regular assessment and adjustments expected over this period in response to outside influences. Given the likely additional pressures we face in the current moment, we anticipate doing even more focused work over the summer with the board and senior leaders. They will review the plan to address this challenge, including the MIIS-specific deficit.\n\n— Even as we’re experiencing record fundraising today, it takes many years for these pledged dollars to manifest in our endowment. Our endowment is smaller than many of our NESCAC peers. This means we continue to have less funding than those peers to support our annual budget, financial aid, salaries, and operating support.\n\nThe items above reflect the most prominent issues we’ve heard in recent discussions. We’ll share others as we hear them in the weeks ahead. And we’ll continue to consider all ideas shared with us. In this process we considered remedies that would have been even more difficult and harmful to morale and the community. This deficit reduction process is not simple or easy. We invite our entire community to be involved in this process and have outlined upcoming opportunities for engagement.\n\nInformation Sessions and Resources\n\nBelow we’ve included additional resources and updates, along with opportunities to connect in the coming weeks:\n\nSharing Ideas\n\nThank you again to all who have submitted a Budget or Structural Change Idea. We’re reviewing your creative, thoughtful suggestions with the appropriate departments. The form remains open, and we welcome additional ideas.\n\nVoluntary Staff Retirement Program\n\nWe’re now reviewing applications from those eligible for the voluntary staff retirement program. The deadline to express interest was Wednesday, April 23, and those who applied will receive individualized agreements by early May so they can consider their options. We encourage any applicants to contact the Human Resources team with questions. Final signed agreements will need to be returned within 45 days. In mid-May, we’ll share information with supervisors about how we will review vacancies created by voluntary retirements. Final information about departures and retirement dates will be shared with supervisors in June.\n\nUpcoming Information Sessions\n\n— Monday, April 28, Vermont Meeting for Staff and Faculty, 9 a.m. ET, Wilson Hall. This will be an opportunity to follow up after several weeks of continued discussion, to provide updates, and to answer questions.\n\n— Monday, April 28, Virtual Meeting for all Staff and Faculty, 4 p.m. ET/1 p.m. PT, Zoom. This will be a similar session to the above 9 a.m. in-person meeting in Vermont, but held on Zoom. Please sign up here to receive the Zoom link.\n\n— Wednesday, May 14, Hybrid Meeting for Staff and Faculty, 2 p.m. ET, Wilson Hall and Zoom. This meeting will focus on updates from the Board of Trustees’ May meeting, including budget discussions and ongoing work. You can sign up for a Zoom link here.\n\nTIAA Representative on Campus\n\nWe’ve arranged for a TIAA representative to be on campus every Wednesday in May and June to consult on retirement contributions and planning. All sessions will be at the Office of Human Resources at 75 Shannon Street. You can sign up for in-person or virtual consultations here (TIAA login required).\n\nHealth Benefits Discussion\n\nWe’ve begun discussions with the Faculty and Staff Resources Committees about options and approaches to health plans. This work will continue through the spring and into summer as a way to bring in faculty and staff voices through the existing governance structure.\n\nFAQs\n\nAs a reminder, we’ve created a list of Frequently Asked Questions and invite you to check back for updates.\n\nThank You\n\nWe know how difficult this work is and the very real impact it has on our community and the people of our community. Thank you for engaging in this process. We’ll be back in touch next week with another update.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Snyder\n\nInterim President\n\n\n\nMichelle McCauley\n\nExecutive Vice President and Provost\n\nDavid Provost\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",

Launched in 1983, the award is the highest recognition bestowed exclusively on alumni, celebrating exceptional contributions in any field of endeavor. “We’re proud to recognize Bill and Lea, two extraordinary alumni whose work has had national impact,” said Hannah Burnett ’10, president of the Middlebury Alumni Association. “Bill has transformed the beverage industry, creating a fast-growing market for a healthier, alternative to traditional beer. Lea has inspired a generation of racers—not only through her own achievements on the world stage but also through her work with Little Bellas, helping young women build confidence and community through cycling.” The Middlebury Alumni Achievement Awards will be presented during Reunion Weekend, June 6–8.\n\nA New Kind of Business Bill Shufelt majored in economics and played on Middlebury’s football team. After college, he pursued a successful career in finance in New York City. A passionate trail runner and beer lover, Shufelt ultimately left a top hedge fund to launch a brewery focused entirely on non-alcoholic beer. “Alcohol had become an artificial ceiling on my goals—both professionally and personally—so I stopped drinking,” said Shufelt. “But I still loved enjoying a great beer with friends and family.” Shufelt saw a gap in the market: no one had created full-flavored, non-alcoholic craft beers for the growing number of Americans who drink infrequently. Athletic Brewing launched in 2018 with a mission to offer adult beverages that didn’t compromise on taste, health, or experience. Today, Athletic Brewing is the largest non-alcoholic beer brand in the U.S. and one of the country’s top 10 craft breweries. The company has twice been named to TIME’s list of the 100 Most Influential Companies and was ranked the 26th fastest-growing private company in the U.S. by Inc. Magazine in 2022. In 2024, Athletic surpassed $95 million in sales and reached a valuation of $800 million. A certified B Corporation, Athletic meets the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. Its Two for the Trails program has contributed more than $6 million to protect and restore outdoor spaces.",

    "content": "Incoming president Ian Baucom delivered the following remarks at a reception yesterday in the Samson Center on the Monterey campus of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n\nThank you for being here and for hosting me and Wendy. It’s so good to be with you. It’s good to be at MIIS. It would be hard for that not to be the case given just how beautiful this place is. When I found out I was becoming president of Middlebury, I knew I’d need to learn how to ski. I didn’t realize I’d also have to learn how to surf.\n\nBut the goodness of this place is about much more than its beauty. It’s about who you are, what you represent, how you embody a way of Middlebury being in the world, and a way of the world gathering itself in Middlebury: from our home campus in Vermont; through our schools around the globe; to the shores of this astonishing and climate-threatened coast.\n\nI want to thank you for that: for choosing to be part of Middlebury; for making us more international, more cosmopolitan; for making us more alive to the vibrancy, richness, and difference of the world family we are.\n\n“A Fundamentally Interconnected World”\n\nAnd I want to thank you that you have chosen to do so in an urgent and demanding way: committing yourself and asking us to think about the nature and future of global conflict; international relations; the precarious ecosystems of our planets and oceans; the vital need for us to understand one another across our differences of language, history, and politics. I want to thank you for understanding the difference that is made when we do and don’t interpret those differences rightly—the difference that language makes, the difference that interpretation makes as coming from diverse places and differing perspectives we seek to build common healthy futures for our planet and our world.\n\nThank you for reminding us that we live in a fundamentally interconnected world—as an institute of international studies so urgently must—and that it is one of the great tasks of education to help us better understand that interrelated world so that we might live well together in it.\n\nThat is something Middlebury has long embodied, through our Language Schools, Schools Abroad, climate commitments, commitment to conflict transformation and cultural understanding. It is something we have embodied through our commitment to opening ourselves to students and faculty and staff coming from all over the globe, as over the course of our history the town’s college has become not only the nation’s college, but the world’s college, and a college for this one planet we call home.\n\nIt is good that we have embodied these things. It is good to be able to name them.\n\nBut because you have committed yourself to urgent and difficult questions, it’s important that I also name difficult things.\n\n“We Live in a Time …”\n\nThe first is that we know that we live in a time when that ethos—that deeply Middlebury and MIIS ethos—of living in and committing to a fundamentally interconnected world is under threat here and in nations around the world. We know that we live in a time of hardening nationalisms, tightening borders, and the sundering of international and transnational economic and political relationships. We know we live in a time when what many of us hold to be true of an interrelated and interdependent world cannot be assumed but must be rearticulated and defended.\n\nWe also know that we live in a time of stringent financial challenges for all institutions of higher education, Middlebury among them: a time in which the postwar partnership between colleges, universities, and the federal government that has enabled countless research discoveries is at risk of being dismantled; a time of market instability; the possibility of increased taxes on the endowments we rely on for financial aid, faculty salaries, and basic operations; and the threat that our doors of admission and federal partnership on financial support for students from around the nation and the world—which we have been working for decades to widen, across all our campuses—may for the first time in our history be pushed more tightly closed; to name only a few of the headwinds blowing.\n\nWe know that if we are going to navigate this time while holding our grounding commitments to research, discovery, and student financial aid that we must do so from the strongest possible financial position, making difficult decisions now to protect our core mission and secure our pledge to Middlebury’s future, as prior generations have done for us. It’s for that reason that I support the truly difficult financial decisions affecting the College that our board, President Snyder, and his leadership team have recently made. As members of our Middlebury community have expressed, their cost is real, they affect real lives, but I firmly believe that they come from a deep loyalty to the institution, a sincere desire to avoid the greater human pain of significant layoffs, stabilize a budget in structural deficit, safeguard us as best as possible from the financial threats of this moment, and secure a route to our future. As hard as this has been—and because of how hard this has been—I am deeply grateful in particular to President Snyder, Provost McCauley, Executive Vice President David Provost, and Board Chair Ted Truscott for their courage and leadership of the Middlebury I know they profoundly love. I am also grateful for the insight that the members of the College Faculty and Staff Councils and other colleagues who equally love Middlebury have shared with me. Thank you, sincerely, all.\n\nWhen I become president on July 1, it will be among my first responsibilities to work in partnership with our faculty, staff, students, leadership team, and board on how—with these hard decisions made and a sounder base under us—we can now move forward to build a stronger financial future together, one not predicated on scarcity but on possibility, one committed to further investing in the faculty and students and staff who are the heart of who we are. I embrace that responsibility and will take it on.\n\nStanding with you here, today, in Monterey, at MIIS, I also know that even as our colleagues in the College are feeling these financial strains that there are equally real financial pressures facing the Institute. I know that you have been taking steps to address them through the plan you have been working through with the Middlebury leadership team and the board. I know that there has been pain here too. Thank you also for the truly hard work you have undertaken.\n\n“Our Core Principles and Commitments”\n\nEven as I thank you, I also know that there are more difficult decisions to come. It is too early in my time—and I am not yet president—to know what form those decisions should take. But come July, I will also be intensely focused on those decisions and options for MIIS, on learning more and working collaboratively as we work through them and acting in ways that are best not only for the moment but for the long future to come—the future of Middlebury as a whole.\n\nAs I join that work, I pledge that our core principles and commitments will remain: we belong to a fundamentally interconnected planet; Middlebury is grounded in place and in the world; our differences enrich us; we will constantly seek to open our doors to students and faculty and staff from around the globe and welcome all as family.\n\nAnd, because we are family, one last word on the challenges of our moment. Beneath these economic hazards and challenges to the idea of the world as constitutively intertwined across national horizons, our moment—as we know well—contains a deeper current of threats, felt across the College, Institute, Schools, and all of higher education alike: threats to the academic freedom and freedom of expression core to our mission, and threats to the equally core freedom to speak regardless of who we are or where we come from. On these fundamental matters of value, I do not need to wait to become president to express what I believe and what I know we all believe. As I said in the remarks I gave in Wilson Hall a few weeks ago, we are for academic freedom and freedom of expression. We will not waver in defense of those freedoms. It is for that reason that I strongly supported the decision by President Snyder for Middlebury to join an amicus brief, as clearly noted on the Middlebury website, “filed by the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration in a lawsuit, brought by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the Middle East Studies Association, which challenges the detentions and deportations that have been occurring to members of higher education communities.”\n\nIt is also for that reason that both President Snyder and I have signed a public letter in defense of academic freedom—jointly organized by the American Association of Colleges and Universities and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and endorsed by over 100 college and university leaders—affirming these key principles:\n\nAmerican institutions of higher learning have in common the essential freedom to determine, on academic grounds, whom to admit and what is taught, how, and by whom. Our colleges and universities share a commitment to serve as centers of open inquiry where, in their pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation.\n\nWe believe in those principles and we will not back away from them. As Alan Garber, president of Harvard, rightly and powerfully put it in his recent letter to the Harvard community: “Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities hold for our country and our world.”\n\n“What We Are For”\n\nI agree and I know that all of Middlebury agrees. This is what we too are for. We always have been, and we always will be.\n\nOne last thing. We are not afraid of this moment. It is the time we inhabit and it is giving us a chance—too rare when life is easy—to say what we are for. So, with your permission, let me repeat here what I had the chance to say a few weeks ago on our home campus in Vermont. Above all, we are for the pursuit of truth. “We are for the wisdom, in Dr. Martin Luther King’s words, that the arc of the moral universe is long, and that it bends toward justice. We are for the conviction that the arc of knowledge is equally long, and that it bends toward truth. We are for the knowledge that in the end truth prevails, and that it does not have a party. It is neither Republican nor Democrat. It seeks its own end and will risk the anger of partisans of all closed perspectives and welcome the friendship of all open minds. It always has, and it always will.”\n\nAnd that, at the beginning and the end, is the beauty of this place. More beautiful than the astonishing Pacific Coast. It is the beautiful truth that you, like everyone who is part of Middlebury, across all our differences of nationality, history, or political perspective, have risked yourself to come pursue the truth: the truth of the international, the truth of language and interpretation; the truth of the climate science, policy, and education on which the future of our planet depends; the truth of the world’s differences joined together, and of the world’s young people living and studying together. How can we be afraid of our moment when those truths sustain us? Whatever course the future runs, how can we be afraid when we know what we are for? To our students—at MIIS, the College, around the world—thank you in particular for coming to Middlebury to pursue those truths. Thank you for your courage. Wherever you go from here I promise you those truths and that courage will sustain you. And we will always call you family. And wherever you go in the world, Middlebury will always be your home.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nYou can learn more about Ian’s appointment, vision, and values in these readings and films.",

    "content": "To Faculty, Staff, and Students,\n\nIn recent days, four members of the Middlebury community—an international student actively enrolled at Middlebury College and three alumni from the Middlebury Institute—had their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records terminated by the U.S. government.\n\nWe have met with our student and contacted our alumni and have been working to support them since we learned of this news.\n\nOur Commitment\n\nWe are not sharing details of these particular cases to preserve the privacy of the individuals; however, we want to provide as much information as we can so our community is informed. We are aware that the revocation of visas is a troubling trend at U.S. colleges and universities and want to express our commitment to supporting our international students, faculty, and staff. Our international community is absolutely integral to Middlebury and inseparable from our identity as an inclusive global community.\n\nContinued Monitoring and Court Actions\n\nSEVIS is the government database used to issue visa-eligibility documents and fulfill compliance requirements for maintaining F-1 and J-1 status. Middlebury’s office of International Student Scholar Services (ISSS) regularly monitors the SEVIS status of Middlebury-sponsored international students and scholars to learn of any unexpected changes and provide them with appropriate guidance including resources for legal representation by an immigration attorney. Representatives from Student Affairs are working with the student to determine next steps. We are doing everything we can to guide and support the student and their family during this difficult time.\n\nMiddlebury must abide by federal laws and regulations related to student and faculty visas and immigration status. We are taking steps to protect our community through legal pathways. On Monday, April 7, Middlebury joined an amicus brief filed by the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration in a lawsuit, brought by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the Middle East Studies Association, which challenges the detentions and deportations that have been occurring to members of higher education communities.\n\nAs stated in the President’s Alliance brief, “U.S. colleges and universities are unmatched centers of learning, discovery, and training. We draw students, scholars, and researchers from across the nation and around the world to learn together, advance knowledge, foster innovation, and contribute to economic growth and global security. Our higher education institutions cultivate domestic and global talent essential to U.S. scientific and technological advancement and all sectors of society. International and immigrant students, faculty, and staff on our campuses and in our communities are integral to America’s leadership in STEM, healthcare, business, teaching, innovation, the arts, and the workforce of tomorrow.”\n\nResources for International Students and Scholars\n\nThe vice president for student affairs, in coordination with the Office of General Counsel and Risk Management, hosted a Zoom conversation for students with immigration attorney Dan Berger on Monday, April 14, focusing on recent immigration policies, traveling abroad, enforcement, and what to expect in 2025 and beyond. We encourage international students and scholars who have questions about their immigration status to contact ISSS so they may discuss their particular situation. Contact and scheduling information can be found on the ISSS website. We continue to add the latest information to our Travel, Regulatory, and Information Updates page.\n\nWe thank you for respecting the privacy of these individuals and anyone else who may encounter this situation. We want to state again, unequivocally, that we are committed to our international community and to preserving the safety and security of all at Middlebury.\n\nWe will keep you informed of any additional information as needed.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Snyder\n\nInterim President\n\nHannah Ross\n\nGeneral Counsel and Chief Risk Officer\n\nMichelle McCauley\n\nExecutive Vice President and Provost",

    "content": "Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students,\n\nAs part of Middlebury’s commitment to emergency preparedness, we will be conducting a second campuswide Shelter in Place Drill on Friday, May 2, from 2:50 to 3 p.m. Similar to the first drill we conducted in December, this exercise is intended to familiarize our community with response terminology and to practice procedures for immediately seeking shelter to avoid a threat or hazard occurring outdoors.\n\nA Shelter in Place order could be used for a wide range of emergency scenarios where keeping our community members behind closed doors is the safest option. Examples of situations when this order may be appropriate include a weather-related emergency, hazardous material release, or an active safety threat occurring nearby. When a threat is deemed credible, Middlebury College will issue this order via our emergency notification system. Those who correctly enter their emergency contact information in our system will receive notifications simultaneously via email, text, and phone call. Emergency notifications issued from the College are identified as “Midd Alert.”\n\nHow it Works\n\nThe drill on May 2 will begin with a Midd Alert message that reads, “Midd Alert – Urgent - This is a Shelter in Place DRILL. Seek shelter in the nearest building away from windows. THIS IS A DRILL. Go to Middalert.net for more information.”\n\nThe text message will begin: “Midd Alert.” Texts will come from a 5-digit number.\n\nThe phone call will come from: 802-388-0409\n\nPlease save this number to your phone contacts as it may come up as spam otherwise. Please remember that if your phone is in Do Not Disturb mode, this notification may not come through. Most phones allow you to make rules or exceptions to your Do Not Disturb mode to bypass specific numbers. Please make sure you include this number on your bypass list.\n\nEmails sent through Midd Alert will come from middlebury@getrave.com, noreply@ravemobilesafety.com, no-reply@ravewireless.com, or middlebury@getrave.com.\n\nOnce the Midd Alert notification is received, we ask that all members of our community make every effort to comply with the instructions provided in the alert. No live simulations, such as for an active shooter, will be included in this drill. There will be no other alerts issued beyond what is outlined in this email. The goal is simply to practice sheltering in place and encourage productive discussions on emergency preparedness and response throughout our community.\n\nDuring the drill, College officials wearing high-visibility vests will be positioned in different areas of the campus. These individuals are there to observe our response and make any necessary recommendations should we ever have the need to shelter in place in the future.\n\nOnce the drill is complete, the College will issue a second Midd Alert message that will read, “Midd Alert - Urgent - ALL CLEAR - The Shelter in Place drill is complete. Please continue on with your day. The drill is complete. ALL CLEAR.”\n\nThis signifies the end of the drill. We expect this drill to take about 10 minutes.\n\nUpdating Your Information\n\nPlease log into Banner Web (students) or Oracle HCM (faculty/staff) to confirm your contact information is correct. We can only send messages to the contact information listed in those systems.\n\nInstructions for Banner Web are as follows:\n\nLog in to Banner Web\n\nSelect: Personal Information\n\nSelect: Update Cell Phone\n\nOnly enter numbers for the cell phone; do not use parentheses or dashes to separate numbers. The system will reconfigure the numbers into United States area codes and the phone number. If there is a college phone in your room or office, you should add this number in the Office or Landline number box.\n\nInstructions for updating information in Oracle HCM can be found here.\n\nIf you do not receive a test message during the drill, please immediately reach out to the Department of Public Safety.\n\nWhat to do in an Actual Emergency\n\nIn the event of an actual emergency, instructions provided through a Midd Alert will be dependent on the event and its location. MiddAlert.net will also be updated with detailed information as we receive it.\n\nWhen a shelter in place order is issued members of the campus community should do the following:\n\nRemain calm and follow the instructions given in the Midd Alert notification.\n\nIf you are inside, stay there even if you do not normally work or reside in that building.\n\nIf you are outside, immediately seek cover in the nearest building. Do not wait until you see or smell the hazard to seek shelter.\n\nFor a threat involving a hazardous material, such as a chemical release, close all exterior windows and doors and stay away from them to the extent possible. If possible, turn off the heating, cooling, and ventilation systems.\n\nFor an active threat, such as an armed intruder, close and lock all exterior doors and windows. Barricade doors, especially if the door cannot be locked. Turn off all lights and silence your cell phones. Notifications on your phone could give away your location. Do not turn off your phone as that will be the primary way for the College to communicate with you.\n\nDo not leave until an “all clear” message is received through the Midd Alert system.\n\nIf you are off campus, follow the directions of local authorities. Do not return to campus, or to the area under a shelter in place order, until an “all clear” message has been received.\n\nAs with all emergencies, go to Midd Alert.net for updated information.\n\nFor more information about our emergency response procedures: go to the Emergency Response website or type “go/er” from the Middlebury network.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email Peter Brown, Emergency Management Coordinator.\n\nThank you in advance for your cooperation,\n\nDemitria Kirby\n\nAssociate Vice President of Safety",

    "content": "The following message was sent to Middlebury faculty, staff, and students on April 2, 2025.\n\nTo Our Community,\n\nIn a letter to you last week we acknowledged the disruptions and uncertainties brought on by new directives out of Washington and how they are affecting us here. The realities of these events, and their repercussions in Middlebury sites around the world, fill our days, as we know they do yours. These are the times we’re in. This is some of the hardest work before us. Tracking the issues closely and supporting this community continue to be of our highest concern.\n\nAt the same time, we’re immersed in another effort that’s critical to the life of this institution, one that we’ve focused on intensely since fall, before any executive order: balancing Middlebury’s budget. We undertook this work with the board’s executive committee and the chairs and vice chairs of the Resources, Strategy, and Risk committees—and recognize now how our attention to the deficit is even more crucial as we see the financial impact of politics on colleges and universities nationwide.\n\nWe’ve concluded that it will take new—and in some ways difficult—steps to shore up Middlebury’s finances, building on work we’ve already been doing. Your dedication to this effort, resourcefulness in figuring out how to do more with less, and patience have brought us far. But the reality is that we have further to go. We must finally put Middlebury on its strongest financial foundation so we can continue to advance our mission to best serve our students, our workforce, higher education, and society at large.\n\nThis letter outlines the beginnings of our plan for financial viability—the what, the why, and the how.\n\nEarlier today we met with faculty and staff representatives in Vermont and Monterey to talk about the issues we’re raising here. We also spoke in advance to outside Middlebury partners who will be affected by our decisions. We’ll reach out to student governance in the days ahead. We know that this is a lot to take in and that you’ll have questions and concerns. We’re planning an active schedule of Q&A and information sessions and will have more information about these by Friday.\n\nThe Latest Figures\n\nWe last reported to you about Middlebury’s budget in late February, following the trustees’ winter meeting.\n\nAt that time, we explained that we’re projecting a $14.1 million deficit this fiscal year, notably higher than our $8.9 million projection from October. The unexpected spike, we said, came from a few sources: Enrollments at the Institute were lower than we planned for, amounting to $8.7 million of the shortfall. There were moderate decreases in tuition revenue at the Language Schools, Bread Loaf, and Schools Abroad, though the Schools as a whole remain revenue positive. And we had significantly higher outlays for healthcare, increased costs for some budgetary items unrelated to salaries or employee benefits, as well as interest and depreciation. Together, these accounted for the other $5.4 million of the projected deficit. Looking forward, we anticipate a similar challenge next year, though we expect that the College will carry a larger portion of the deficit compared with the Institute or Schools.\n\nWe want to emphasize that the deficit we’re addressing in this message is at the College. At MIIS we continue to pursue the four-year plan to turn around enrollments.\n\nThe trustees, of course, are keenly aware of these numbers and our finances overall, since a primary charge of any governing board is to ensure the financial health of their organization. Guided by the senior administration, they’re regularly tracking the budget dynamics through each fiscal year—its current state, projections, stressors, trends—while at the same time keeping the long view. That’s because at an institution like Middlebury, trustees have another core responsibility: to continually ask how our actions today might influence Middlebury tomorrow. How our actions today can ensure that this institution is relevant, salient, and secure a decade, a generation, and even a century from now.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTo say it as clearly as possible, our challenge is this: We haven’t been able to balance our books despite significant progress in how we do business. We simply must get ourselves to the balanced budget that has eluded us, year over year, to be able to support our mission today and into the future. We all know what that mission is: preparing students to lead engaged, consequential, and creative lives; contribute to their communities; address the world’s most challenging problems through our commitment to immersive learning. It’s both a mission and an obligation to continue to provide one of the most extraordinary and relevant experiences in higher education.\n\nCarrying a deficit every June 30, as we’ve done for too long, is too great a weight, one that eventually will hamper our ability to deliver on our mission. Our deficits are continually an outlier among our NESCAC peers, which all operate profitably, experiencing only occasional downturns. And there are signs that financial pressures will only increase, as we hear of plans, for instance, to tax endowments at 14 percent or even 21 percent, up from 1.4 percent today. Despite popular criticisms, an endowment is the financial backbone that’s put to use every day, enabling an institution like ours to live and make good on our values. One of those values is access. Middlebury is a private institution but also a public good, and we believe a public good should be accessible to all regardless of ability to pay.\n\nBy balancing our books, living within our means, we’ll put ourselves in the best position to support what matters here. Offering one of the finest educational experiences in the world, and everything that that entails, and taking care of a workforce that each day makes Middlebury the singular place it is—these are products of a financially stronger institution.\n\nThese have been the overriding themes of our discussions with the board. These are the reasons that the trustees have directed senior leadership to develop a plan to balance the budget over the coming fiscal years. The first elements of the plan are outlined below. Others will require more research, which we’ll continue to do in the months ahead and share with you along the way.\n\nProgress to Date\n\nWe mentioned that we’ve already made significant progress against the budget gap. This is what that looks like from the institutional long-term view to ensure that Middlebury is maintaining its financial resources for future generations. We continue to manage our endowment wisely, surpassing industry benchmarks for 3, 5, 10, and 15 years and staying the course on drawing 5 percent from the endowment annually. This is the result of the attention we’ve paid to fiscal discipline, and it has improved Middlebury’s long-term financial health, fed our operating budgets, and enabled us to offer competitive aid packages for our students and families. For our workforce, we’ve been able to increase salaries each of the last three years—7 percent, 5 percent, and 4 percent respectively—resulting in a $22 million increase overall. We’ve brought staff salaries to market and also improved the wage differentials for evenings and weekends.\n\nWe want to stress that it’s taken all of us to achieve results like these, to make progress against really stubborn headwinds. And we’ve made excellent progress. The hard reality is, we still have more to do.\n\nGuiding Principles\n\nWe were guided in our decision-making by these three principles:\n\nThe student experience will only be strengthened by these moves. For our students and families, Middlebury will continue to be all that we promise it will be during the admissions process. The student experience here is strong. This budget work will only strengthen it further.\n\nWe want the least disruption possible for our workforce as a whole. As we’ve examined all possible means to promote fiscal health, we sought to avoid any widespread impacts to our workforce. As we work with you to determine Middlebury’s future state, we’ll be supportive, collaborative, and sympathetic in any decisions we need to make.\n\nWe need to simplify our organizational structure, which is too complex. While we have more research to do, we know there’s overlap of work in some areas across the institution, and we’ll better serve our mission by being more efficient. We’ll continue to assess and communicate at the appropriate time. Already we’ve looked at efficiency in the 17-member Senior Leadership Group: the full SLG will now meet monthly, not weekly, to take up issues that intersect all our administrative areas, and we’ll create a smaller working group to bring more focus and faster decision-making to the institution.\n\nClosing the Budget Gap\n\nBuilding on the work we’ve done, these are the actions we’ll take to begin to bring expenses at the College in line with revenues, and sustain that into the future. With these first measures we expect to realize more than $10 million of savings.\n\nRetirement Incentive for Vermont-Based Staff: We’ll offer a financial incentive for Vermont-based employees to take an early retirement. This incentive will be available to all Vermont-based staff who are at least 55 years of age and who have at least 10 years of service to Middlebury. Human Resources will have all the details in the days ahead for those who are eligible.\n\nRetirement Match of 11 Percent: Effective January 1, 2026, the highest contribution level will be an 11 percent match for retirement, and we’ll no longer offer 15 percent. The 11 percent still places Middlebury’s contribution among the best of our peers, and has been the highest rate for eligible employees who joined Middlebury after 2017. During the fall semester we’ll have details and documents to share for those whose plans are affected. There are no other changes to our retirement program or vendor, TIAA.\n\nRental Properties: We’ll reduce the number of leases by relocating the Arabic, Italian, and Portuguese Language Schools to Middlebury’s campus in summer 2027 from Bennington College, which has hosted them since 2022. In summer 2026, Advancement will move to Marble Works, which we own, from their leased space on Exchange Street.\n\nUndergraduate Enrollment: Four years ago, during the pandemic, we enrolled an exceptionally large class, the Class of 2025, bringing total enrollment to more than 2,800. This presented challenges, but as we enrolled subsequent classes we found we could support an undergraduate population of more than our historical 2,500. We’ll grow back undergraduate enrollment to between 2,600 and 2,650 over the next few years, which will be manageable without a parallel increase in faculty or staff.\n\nHealth Insurance: We’re evaluating our health insurance plans, employee contributions and deductibles, and plan designs and comparing them to benefits at peer institutions. If we make changes, we’ll announce them this fall and not implement them until January 1, 2026.\n\n……………..\n\nWe want to close, for now, by acknowledging that what we’ve said here might be difficult to process right away or just difficult to hear. We know, too, that we’re delivering this news at a time when issues outside Middlebury bring their own stresses and uncertainties. We’ll be talking a lot in the weeks and months ahead at in-person sessions and on zoom to address your concerns, answer your questions, and share the progress we’re making in this effort.\n\nWith gratitude and appreciation,\n\nSteve Snyder\n\nInterim President\n\nMichelle McCauley\n\nExecutive Vice President and Provost\n\nDavid Provost\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nVermont Staff Retirement Incentive Program\n\nWho is eligible for the retirement incentive program?\n\nVermont-based staff members aged 55 or older with at least 10 consecutive years of service as of June 1, 2025.\n\nWho is not eligible for the retirement incentive program?\n\nStaff working in support of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\nHead coaches in Athletics, who are classified as faculty.\n\nAll faculty, including those holding administrative appointments.\n\nStaff whose positions are gift, grant-funded, endowed, or term appointments.\n\nMembers of the Senior Leadership Group.\n\nAre faculty included in this retirement incentive?\n\nNo. We offered an incentive for faculty a few years ago and given that we have no plans to reduce the number of faculty or change the student-to-faculty ratio, faculty are not being offered this incentive.\n\nHow many employees are eligible, and what is the participation target?\n\nApproximately 180 staff are eligible. We do not have a defined target, but we estimate that approximately 15 percent or more of those eligible will participate, based on historical data.\n\nWhat happens if not enough people take the incentive?\n\nIf acceptance of these offers is low, leadership and the Board of Trustees will reassess this program, along with all the other plans we’ve shared.\n\nWill managers receive a list of eligible staff?\n\nAny supervisor who has one or more eligible staff members has been informed. We have not shared the specific names of those eligible because this is simply eligibility, not a commitment. We want to protect the privacy and autonomy of each eligible staff member so they may fully consider this option. Two information sessions were held this week for supervisors to ensure they are informed and supported.\n\nIs there any flexibility on eligibility (e.g., someone age 55+ with 8 years or 54 years old with 10 years of service)?\n\nNo. The policy requires 55 years of age and 10 consecutive years of service.\n\nWhat is the timeline for the incentive?\n\nEligible staff received materials on Monday, April 7. Anyone interested in learning more about the program will need to complete an application by Wednesday, April 23, by 5 p.m. Agreements will all be sent by early May. All decisions and agreements will be finalized by the end of June.\n\nPeople are feeling pressured to take the incentive program because they don’t know what is coming next or they want to help avoid layoffs. Should people be worried about this?\n\nThe incentive aims to offer choice, flexibility, and support, and the decision to participate or not is entirely that of the eligible staff member. There is no stated or implied pressure to take this offer. We encourage individuals to make this significant decision based on what is right for them. We are not planning layoffs at this time.\n\nRetirement Contribution Tier Adjustment\n\nWhat’s changing with the retirement contribution?\n\nAll employees in Tier IV of our retirement benefit group, who are currently receiving 15 percent matches, will shift to an 11 percent match, effective January 1, 2026.\n\nHow many employees are affected?\n\n622 faculty and staff are currently in Tier IV.\n\nWhat are the estimated savings from this change?\n\nWe expect that this will save approximately $2.5 million annually, with half of the savings realized in fiscal year 2026 and half in fiscal year 2027.\n\nWhy was this change made when it was and wasn’t this promised to employees at the time they were hired?\n\nThe 15 percent match was a benefit, not a contractual guarantee. As part of our consideration of how we can achieve a balanced budget with the least impact to all employees, we decided to make this change. The leadership recognized the impact of this change and did not make the decision lightly.\n\nIs the dependent tuition benefit also at risk?\n\nThere are no current plans to change the dependent education benefit.\n\nOrganizational Planning\n\nHow will staff retirements be managed?\n\nSome positions may be replaced quickly, while others may be reviewed or paused depending on institutional priorities. The approach will be student centered and cross-departmental. We are working to develop an intentional, collaborative process and will share more in the coming weeks.\n\nAre layoffs being planned?\n\nNo. We are not planning layoffs at this time.\n\nAre specific departments being targeted?\n\nNo. Staffing decisions will be made with institutional needs in mind, not at the departmental level.\n\nWhat about departments that are already understaffed?\n\nWhile the institution is overstaffed overall, some areas are critically short staffed. We recognize these concerns and will consider these factors closely as we move forward.\n\nProgram and Operational Adjustments\n\nWhat role does MIIS play in the budget deficit?\n\nMIIS has an $8.7M projected deficit. However, the College and Schools still would face a projected deficit next year of between $11 million and $13 million without MIIS. A Board of Trustees-approved, four-year plan is in place to address the budget deficit at MIIS.\n\nWhat about travel expenses? Can we reduce travel to make up part of the deficit?\n\nThe total travel budget is currently about $9 million. This idea has been raised before, but cutting travel is complex because many departments view their travel as essential. As we move forward, we will consider this and all ideas suggested to us.\n\nEndowment and Financial Management\n\nWhy not draw more from the endowment to cover the gap?\n\nThe board capped our draw at 5 percent to maintain long-term financial sustainability. Drawing more could reduce future funding and increase our exposure to the federal endowment tax. Endowment tax increases that are currently under consideration could raise our tax bill from $1 million to $12 million.\n\nWho manages the endowment?\n\nOur endowment is managed by Investure, an external investment firm. They oversee asset allocation strategy for Middlebury and many other colleges and universities.\n\nWhat is the long-term strategy for resolving the deficit?\n\nOur goal is to address the $10 million to $15 million gap through structural changes—while avoiding layoffs and preserving our mission.",

    "content": "Brett Gilman ’24.5 has been awarded a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, a one-year, $40,000 grant for self-guided exploration outside of the United States. Gilman is an independent scholar who designed his own major around socio-ecological studies in landscape architecture. He plans to travel to five countries—the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Singapore, and Australia—to study landscape design movements.\n\n“I am excited to step outside of a professional trajectory, step off the academic ladder, and stretch myself to undertake a specific personal journey of growth,” said Gilman. “Most of all, I am excited to immerse myself in my passion, envisioning a better world through the lens of gardening.”\n\nGilman’s Watson Fellowship is a continuation of the independent path he charted for himself at Middlebury—but now on a global scale, notes his academic advisor Pieter Broucke, professor of History of Art and Architecture. “Brett taught me to look at landscape design not as an aesthetic exercise but as arguably the main tool we have to mitigate the effects of climate change,” said Broucke. “He sees landscape design as a means with which to address some of the world’s most challenging problems.”\n\nGilman said when he started learning about the field of landscape architecture, he realized that by designing his own major at Middlebury he could combine his interests in conservation biology, fine art and design, art history, philosophy, and environmental policy. The combination has given him a helpful perspective for the year ahead and beyond.\n\n“I imagine that a year of delving into the gardens, designed landscapes, and wild places that most inspire me will seed an innovative foundation for a career creating socially and ecologically connected landscape projects of my own,” said Gilman. “I envision the Watson propelling me into graduate study in landscape architecture or a professional training program in environmental horticulture.”\n\nAs a Middlebury student, Gilman founded a local chapter of the Pollinator Pathway, a grassroots community network establishing pollinator-friendly habitat along contiguous corridors. He also served as co-manager of the Sunday Night Environmental Group, and was president of Middlebury Geographic, a student-led publication that celebrated its 15th anniversary edition last fall. He was inspired to pursue a Watson after study abroad experiences in Oxford and Copenhagen.\n\nDuring his fellowship year, Gilman, of Wilton, Connecticut, will collaborate with horticulturalists, landscape architects, environmental thinkers, art institutions, and community garden networks to learn how to create everyday outdoor spaces that are “lively, functional, biodiverse, and resilient.” In preparation for his time abroad, he will be working as a horticulture intern at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham, Massachusetts, the nation’s first plant conservation organization.\n\nFounded in 1968, the Watson Fellowship is award­ed to graduating seniors nominated by one of 41 partner institutions. Gilman is among the 37 fellows selected for Watson’s 57th class.\n\nFor more information about this and other fellowships, visit Middlebury’s Fellowships Office.",

    "content": "Dear Middlebury Community,\n\nAs we return to campus for the second half of the spring semester, we want to welcome you back and provide an update on issues of concern to our community.\n\nIn the weeks since the U.S. presidential transition, we—along with all of higher education—have been closely monitoring national events to guide how we respond in this time of uncertainty, confusion, and swift change. We have been doing substantial outreach and giving support to our community members who are most directly affected by the various administrative orders. And we have been in discussion with organizations, including at the national level, that are working through the same disruptive environment.\n\nWe want to make this clear from the start: We know our entire community is affected by current events. We will continue to support all our students, faculty, and staff based in our core and shared values. We remain fully committed to our educational mission.\n\nThe Three Pillars\n\nThat mission declares the right of academic freedom, the responsibility of personal and professional integrity, and the value of respect. These are our three pillars, and they signify that, in our pursuit of knowledge and understanding of a complex world, all community members have the essential right to freely speak, listen, write, challenge, and argue—and that we as an institution will defend and protect this right, even when doing so may offend some.\n\nThese pillars are foundational to the wider enterprise of higher education and to our specific commitment to immersive learning; to preparing our students to lead engaged, consequential, and creative lives and contribute to their communities; and to addressing the world’s most challenging problems.\n\nGrounded in these values, we will continue to closely monitor developments and support members of our community. In our outreach since the presidential transition we have consulted with or addressed numerous individuals and groups throughout Middlebury, including Faculty Council, Staff Council, Leadership Alliance, International Student and Scholar Services, and the Middlebury Institute to share what we know now about the rapidly shifting political and legal landscapes. We have said in those meetings that we are tracking several executive orders that have direct implications for higher education and assessing how they might affect our operations, activities, research efforts, and funding as a whole. We remain focused on fulfilling our mission while abiding by the law.\n\nWith all of this in mind, we have these updates on specific issues of the moment:\n\nOpen Expression\n\nMiddlebury’s commitment to open expression has not changed. We continue to uphold robust dialogue on issues and concerns of the day, even among those with whom we might disagree. Middlebury’s policy does not, however, limit or constrain the U.S. government and its control over immigration status. Therefore, individuals’ actions may have implications for their immigration status and ability to remain in the United States. We are closely monitoring any changes in policy or the law and will continue to share information as it becomes available.\n\nEndowment\n\nWhile Middlebury has a considerable endowment and a supportive alumni and donor base, we rely on federal funding for research and student financial aid. We also continue to operate with a budget deficit. We are, therefore, closely monitoring any guidelines and laws to be sure we are in compliance with the latest regulations. We also will monitor any potential changes to the way our endowment is taxed.\n\nFederal Funds for Academic and Nonacademic Programs\n\nThe executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion; foreign aid; and environmental justice tasked all federal agencies with analyzing their funding portfolios. At the conclusion of those analyses, we expect to receive further notice about how any of our awarded grants will be impacted. For now, we are proceeding with our teaching and research mission as usual. Although numerous executive orders have been challenged in the courts by impacted groups, it will be some time before these legal proceedings are resolved. For now, we must abide by existing laws and follow federal guidelines as we receive them.\n\nInternational Students and Scholars\n\nThe Office of International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) has been in regular communication with our international community in response to executive orders and other government guidance as it becomes available. At this time, we are advising foreign nationals/international students and scholars to carry their personal identification documents and immigration/travel documents with them when in the United States, especially when in the 100-mile border zone, due to expectations of increased screening and document checking. Middlebury’s campuses are all within the 100-mile border zone, as coastal areas are also considered borders.The website of NAFSA Association of International Educators provides contextual information on travel bans and restrictions. Other information is posted on our Travel Updates webpage.\n\nOffice of Civil Rights List of Investigations\n\nMiddlebury received communication from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in March 2024 when a complaint about antisemitism was made, and we have been cooperating with its investigation. Earlier this month, we were among 60 schools that received a follow-up letter saying the investigation would be revisited. We will continue to cooperate with OCR. Again, we are committed to our educational mission, and that includes supporting all students with no tolerance for discriminatory behavior on our campuses.\n\nEquity and Inclusion\n\nFinally, we promised to provide an update on the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (OIDEI), following our announcement three weeks ago that Vice President Khuram Hussain has chosen for personal reasons to step down from his administrative role at the end of June to become a full-time member of the faculty. Since we announced this change, we have been in discussions about how to best fulfill the functions of the office and sustain our commitment to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming community at Middlebury.\n\nWe will transition oversight of several groups from OIDEI to Student Affairs in the coming months: the Anderson Freeman Resource Center, Scott Center for Spiritual and Religious Life, Prism Center for Queer and Trans Life, and the Education for Equity teams. The Civil Rights/Title IX Office and the Disability Resource Center are reporting to the Office of General Counsel for oversight of these crucial compliance functions, for at least the next 18 months. We will share more information about the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office and the assistant vice president for equity and inclusion role at a later date. They will continue to report to Khuram in the interim.\n\nThank You\n\nWe understand how difficult it is to be living and working in this environment. We know that this is a lot to process and that many of you are concerned about how you and your colleagues and families will be affected. We are mindful of how broad the impacts can be of actions taken by the federal government, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to Middlebury’s mission and vision, and our foundational values of academic freedom, integrity, and respect. We will keep working with offices across Middlebury as well as national organizations supporting higher education to monitor federal actions and all subsequent legal challenges with diligence. We will share further information as and when it becomes available.\n\nIn the meantime, international students, faculty, and staff should reach out to ISSS with questions; students with questions about programs or the centers should reach out to the vice president for Student Affairs, and those needing legal advice on behalf of the institution should contact the Office of General Counsel.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Snyder\n\nInterim President\n\nMichelle McCauley\n\nExecutive Vice President and Provost\n\nHannah Ross\n\nGeneral Counsel and Chief Risk Officer",

The Center for Teaching, Learning, and Research (CTLR) and the Advisory Group on Disability Access and Inclusion (AGDAI) award the $1,000 prize annually to a Middlebury faculty member.\n\nAccording to her students, Parshina established and effectively communicated clear academic standards and course policies, including grading rubrics that were easy to understand in her Introduction to Psychology course. They appreciated her use of a link to allow anonymous feedback on the course and her prompt responses to adjust the course when appropriate.\n\n“Following the principles of inclusively designed teaching, this award celebrates colleagues who focus especially on clarity, choice and equity, and flexibility,” said Susan Burch, professor of American Studies and a member of the Advisory Group on Disability Access and Inclusion.\n\nParshina, who joined Middlebury in 2023, studies online language processing in unique populations, such as bilingual and monolingual adults and children, including those with learning disabilities such as dyslexia. In particular, her research investigates the questions concerning reading skill development using eye-tracking technology to learn more about what eye movements can tell us about sentence processing in these readers.\n\nThe Middlebury College community honored Parshina’s work, along with other nominees, at a reception at CTLR on February 19.\n\nFor more information, including nomination details, visit the Inclusive Design Award website.",

She is developing an interactive map that integrates photography, interviews, and soundscapes to illustrate how water access shapes daily life.\n\n“Teaching English has been about so much more than language—it’s been an opportunity to engage in cultural exchange at its best,” said Babbott-Bryan, who also works with a student-led club focused on local restoration projects and environmental issues. “Beyond teaching, I am continually inspired by the strength and resistance I encounter every day.”\n\nElizabeth (Ellie) Suit ’24 is conducting research in Belgium as part of the Theory of Quantum and Complex Systems group at the University of Antwerp in support of their work in ultracold atomic physics.\n\n“I feel fortunate to be welcomed into my community here in Antwerp and the opportunity from Fulbright to be a part of creating a mutual understanding between Belgium and the U.S., ” said Suit. “As a scientific researcher, I am also excited about the chance to create these connections to spark future international collaborations motivated towards developing new theories and understandings of quantum physics.”\n\nThe Fulbright program has produced 44 heads of state or government, 62 Nobel Laureates, 90 Pulitzer Prize winners, 82 MacArthur Fellows, and other leaders focused on building strong connections between the United States and other countries.\n\nThe Following is a list of Middlebury’s 2024-2025 recipients.

    "content": "Middlebury College has received a gift of $5 million from an anonymous donor to establish the Robert P. Martin Professorship, honoring a professor who led the creation of Middlebury’s computer science program.\n\nThe endowed professorship will support “a teacher and scholar of true eminence and excellence” in fields emphasizing data study and application, said Dan Courcey, vice president for Advancement. “Data analysis plays a pivotal role across industries and fields of study, and understanding AI and data manipulation is vital for staying competitive in today’s workforce.”\n\nThe Martin Professorship is the eighth faculty position endowed through For Every Future: The Campaign for Middlebury. Increasing support for academics is a key campaign goal, with $94 million raised so far for academic programs. The total raised over the course of the campaign for all priorities is $514 million toward a goal of $600 million.\n\n“Endowed professorships help us attract and retain exceptional faculty—enriching the student experience and reinforcing our commitment to academic rigor and creativity,” said Steve Snyder, Middlebury’s interim president.\n\nRobert Martin joined Middlebury in 1976 as an assistant professor of mathematics and quickly gained a reputation for his creative teaching methods. He developed courses that were as imaginative as they were rigorous, including “Calculus for the Social Sciences,” “The Mathematics of Rubik’s Cube,” and cryptology. Martin’s ability to blend creativity with critical thinking inspired generations of students.\n\nMartin’s influence extended beyond mathematics. Recognizing the growing importance of computer science, he took a sabbatical in 1980 to study at Harvard and MIT. Upon returning, he led the creation of Middlebury’s computer science major, blending technical expertise with the liberal arts focus on critical thinking. Today, computer science is one of Middlebury’s most popular programs.\n\n“Bob Martin saw early on how developments in computer science would reshape the way we live and work,” said the donor, one of Martin’s former students who graduated in the 1990s. “Thanks to his efforts, Middlebury students were prepared for those changes. Today, AI, data science, and digital methods are transforming the world just as profoundly. I want to help ensure that Middlebury continues to prepare students to navigate and lead in this new digital era.”\n\nOne example of Martin’s ingenuity was the Green Chicken Contest, an annual math competition he co-founded with a Williams College colleague in 1978. The prize? A chartreuse, chicken-shaped chafing dish once owned by Martin’s sister. Nearly 50 years later, the tradition continues, reflecting Martin’s enduring legacy of blending rigor with joy.\n\n“Professor Martin was an exceptional teacher and mentor,” the donor said. “He pushed us to think critically and creatively, to grow intellectually, and to build confidence in our abilities. He approached even the driest subjects with humor, transforming them into something engaging and fun.”\n\nMartin’s far-reaching contributions not only as a teacher but also in advancing the field of computer science inspired the donor to establish the professorship.\n\n“We believe in the power of education and the role educators like Professor Martin play in fostering excellence,” the donor said. “The impact he had on students was remarkable, and we wanted to honor his memory in a way that keeps his spirit of curiosity and innovation alive.”",

    "content": "The Middlebury Board of Trustees at its February 7-8 winter meeting in New York approved a new comprehensive fee for the undergraduate College that brings the total cost of attendance for the 2025-26 academic year to $90,756.\n\nThe vote to increase the fee by 4.5 percent brings tuition to $70,120, room and board to $20,116, and sets the Student Government Association fee at $520. David Provost, executive vice president for finance and administration, presented data showing that the College’s cost of attendance remains in the middle of its peer institutions. The board reaffirmed Middlebury’s commitment to providing significant financial support to students. The average net cost of attendance after financial aid last year was $31,483 with the average financial aid offer over $65,000.\n\nPresident’s Report\n\nOn Saturday, Stephen Snyder gave his first report as interim president thanking members of the Senior Leadership Group for their support and partnership during the presidential transition. He also thanked members of the Presidential Search Committee including Chair Kirtley Cameron for making the search process meaningful and for the selection of Ian Baucom as the College’s 18th president. Baucom, along with his wife, Wendy, were officially introduced to the trustees the previous day.\n\nFinancial Update\n\nAlso on Saturday, Provost told trustees that the Fiscal Year 2025 deficit now stands at $14.1 million, higher than the $8.9 million projection in October. The Middlebury Institute of International Studies accounts for $8.7 million due primarily to low enrollment, resulting in less than anticipated tuition revenue. The majority of the remaining deficit of approximately $5.4 million was attributed to the College and the Schools, including slightly lower than anticipated tuition revenue from the Language Schools, Bread Loaf, and Schools Abroad, growing health care costs, higher than expected costs not related to salaries or employee benefits, and interest and depreciation. The board directed senior leadership to bring forth plans to achieve a balanced budget for FY26 and FY27, and this work is ongoing.\n\nConstruction Update and Motions\n\nDuring the meetings on Saturday, trustees approved spending up to $13 million for the renovation of Stewart Hall, a first-year residence hall. The timing of this project is driven by two important factors: First, significant improvements are needed, including bathroom facilities, HVAC and building envelope systems, accessibility and life safety systems, and a new elevator serving all five floors. Second, during the renovation period there is an opportunity to house students in the existing Battell Hall before it is torn down. This critical housing space would not be available if the project is delayed to some time in the future.\n\nThe board also agreed to allocate up to $3 million for the renovation of Armstrong Library in Bicentennial Hall to fully convert the space to a Quantitative Center, and $2 million to upgrade the Kirk Alumni Center.\n\nTrustees approved the recommendation of the Building, Grounds, and Lands Committee and the Resources Committee to name the new 87,000-square-foot residence hall, located on the north side of Battell Beach, as Battell Hall—keeping the name of the nearby residence hall that stood for almost 70 years. This is in keeping with how current students and alumni refer to the new residence hall.\n\nThe board also authorized the purchase of Perry Farm—a 54-acre parcel located in Cornwall at the corner of Cider Mill Road and Route 125—for a total $525,000, using funds from the sale of other properties. The property is close to campus and adjacent to a property that will ultimately be gifted to the College.\n\nMIIS Update\n\nMichelle McCauley​, executive vice president and provost, updated trustees on a comprehensive plan to make the Middlebury Institute financially viable within three years. During the past year, MIIS underwent a reorganization of programs and staffing, resulting in cost reductions of just under $3 million. The plan included the phasing out of under-enrolled specializations, creating enhanced digital tools for students to track their progress​, and the addition of three degree programs that will be taught by current faculty.\n\nMcCauley shared that the Institute will launch two new online programs in the next fiscal year and create more connections and coordination between language offerings at MIIS and the Middlebury Language Schools and CV Schools Abroad. The Institute also will partner with other schools. McCauley highlighted a new study-away program, a plus-one master’s degree program in global security and environment, and recent changes in the office of Executive and Custom Programs.",

    "content": "Middlebury has launched a financial aid challenge to raise $20 million for endowments to sustain its commitment to making Middlebury affordable for all admitted students.\n\nThanks to the generosity of three alumni from the classes of 1983, 1988, and 1990, Middlebury will match gifts to establish new financial aid funds up to $1 million per fund through the Endow the Future Challenge. A total of $10 million is available to match gifts from donors establishing their first endowed scholarship funds.\n\n“Financial aid is what makes Middlebury accessible to talented students from every background,” said Dan Courcey, vice president for Advancement. “When we admit a student, we make a commitment to meet that student’s financial need. Endowed scholarships help us to keep that promise.”\n\nThe challenge is part of Middlebury’s larger $600 million fundraising effort, For Every Future: the Campaign for Middlebury. Supporting access to a Middlebury education is the top priority in the campaign, and Middlebury has raised $158 million toward supporting access since the start of the campaign in July 2023.\n\nDonors who make a minimum commitment of $125,000 over five years (or fewer) to establish a new scholarship endowment qualify for the match. Starting last fall, gifts to scholarship funds established by classes without an existing class scholarship also became eligible.\n\nCurrently, nearly half of Middlebury students rely on financial aid. The average grant exceeds $60,000 annually.\n\n“The need for financial aid has never been greater on a national level,” said Interim President Steve Snyder. “This initiative is a way for donors to have a lasting impact on the people of this institution by supporting the students who need financial assistance to attend Middlebury.”\n\nThe endowment provides a permanent source of support for students, faculty, and programs. While some gifts meet immediate needs, endowed funds grow over time through investment and continued giving, ensuring their sustainability into the future.\n\n“Our challenge donors are passionate about building a stronger foundation for Middlebury,” Courcey said. “They want to inspire others to contribute, and we’re deeply grateful for their vision and leadership.”\n\nSince the challenge launched in October, donors have committed $2.3 million, creating 13 new funds. Matching funds will be applied once all pledge payments have been fulfilled. An additional 27 proposals for new funds are currently under consideration.",

    "content": "As Middlebury anticipates the arrival of its 18th president, who will take office July 1, 2025, we offer this glimpse into his person, his values, and his perspectives—on Middlebury, on higher education and the liberal arts, on our shared responsibilities to the wider world. We sat down with Ian in his office on the campus of the University of Virginia and covered this ground:\n\n\n\nA Defining Institution | 00:00\n\nThe Liberal Arts | 01:48\n\nEnvironmental Stewardship | 04:34\n\nEducation and Human Dignity | 06:27\n\nMiddlebury and Middlebury People | 09:05\n\nHeadwinds and Opportunities | 10:01\n\n“I Can’t Wait” | 15:37\n\nA Defining Institution\n\n\n\nHow do I feel? Do I feel weightier? Do I feel lighter? I think I feel both. The presidency is a defining role for an institution. And to accept the position as president means that you have the responsibility to serve a community that is present to you, community that has preceded you, in this case by centuries. And you’re also serving a future to come.\n\n\n\nAnd that’s a, that’s a weighty responsibility. And, and I feel it. I’ve had the opportunity to lead before I’ve led a college. I’ve been provost, I’ve been a department chair. And with all of those, it’s a similar thing. But the president holds that responsibility of stewarding the university, stewarding the college. for the time they’re honored to hold it and for time to come.\n\n\n\nAnd I feel light. I feel this amazing sense of joy. The liberal arts are at the core of who I am. And to have the opportunity to come to a college, to work with the institute, to work with the schools, to work with our students and faculty and staff, to be bound together by that richness and rigor and complexity of liberal arts education, living together, thinking together, being Middlebury in the world, seeing the world come to Middlebury, there is this lightness and joy that comes with it. Middlebury’s a defining institution in the history of American life.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Arts\n\n\n\nIt’s not an accident that the liberal arts begin with liber, to be free. And the liberal arts at their core, to my mind, are the art and the possibility of what it means to be a free human being. And to take on the opportunity and the responsibility of freedom, to think what the greater freedom of the world could be. Not abstractly, but by the pursuit of knowledge and not knowledge in the abstract, but in the particular, through poetry, through biology, through the quantitative sciences, through understanding of the physical nature of our universe, through dance. Liberal arts begin there. They begin with each person who is touched and shaped and changed by them. And then they have gathered over centuries, into this opportunity to collect, young lives, young women, young men, young non-binary students, who for four years, can be surrounded by the possibility of all that we’ve known and all that we don’t yet know.\n\n\n\nAnd by faculty who know that it is worth dedicating your full life to that purpose. And then the institutions of a college, that each year have the opportunity to see a class of first-year students unpacking their bags, walking into a dorm, signing up for classes, had the gift of that gathering of life. And also know that the possibility of the gift of freedom through knowledge that the liberal arts offers, is not only for those students, but for the communities in which the colleges sit, the town of Middlebury, the state of Vermont, our nation, our world. That what happens in Middlebury, what happens in Monterey, what happens in the summer, what happens in the language schools, what happens in France, and in Morocco, is part of our commitment to the world that liberal arts have been shaped by and, and shaped. The liberal arts are in many ways the art of democratic life.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n\n\n\nOne of the things that has most attracted me to Middlebury is the profound commitment, enduring over generations, and renewed most recently under President Patton’s leadership and by the faculty and staff, to the future of our planet. The care for environment, the incredible challenge of taking on the realities of what climate change is producing. As we sit in my office today, we know that Los Angeles is burning. And we know that around the world, there are people in communities, large and small, whose lives will be thrown often into mortal peril by the reality of climate change. To understand climate is to understand climate science, but it’s to understand economics and policy. It’s to have a deep understanding of how we wrestle with our ethical commitments, our commitments to one another, our commitments to future generations. It takes philosophy. To understand climate change means that we need to be thrown out of ourselves and out of what is comfortable, and that so deeply is the work of the arts. Liberal arts are all of those.\n\n\n\nThere are politics and economics and sociology and law, the data sciences, the quantitative sciences, the humanities and the arts, for their own sake. And because drawn together, they allow us to inhabit that world, and to try to take on our responsibility to it.\n\n\n\nEducation and Human Dignity\n\n\n\nAs a child, I grew up in South Africa during the Apartheid years. My mom and dad ran adult literacy programs for mine workers. When I was a little boy, I was just a little boy. And my childhood was just a childhood, but it was a childhood in a place that was marked by a profound violence and a profound injustice, and an order of racial exclusion. And as I got older, into my early teens, there was nothing remarkable about this coming into awareness, but I came into awareness that I was surrounded by a deep wrong. And I was surrounded by people—Black South Africans, Indian South Africans, South Asian South Africans—who didn’t enjoy the rights that I did, and yet held them within the dignity of their person. But the law did not recognize that. Where the passage into the fullness of rights began was in many places. Civic organizations, unions, churches, literary gatherings, neighborhood meetings, people of profound courage and in schools, and in universities. And I began to see, because of the work of others, my parents among them, but not my parents alone, that education could not only change individual lives, one by one by one, but that the collective and common work of education could open a society. And so that connection between the dignity of the person, the rights that we should all enjoy, and the unfinished business of democracy coming together through the pursuit of the education of all, was marked from that moment.\n\n\n\nMiddlebury and Middlebury People\n\n\n\nWhat did I learn about the character of Middlebury people from the process of the interview? So, a couple things. One was, Kirtley Cameron, who worked with Ted and the whole committee on the search, she opened the interview process, and the very first thing she said was, we go by first names here. Is that okay? And, by the way, I’m Ian. It was a very simple thing, but you can tell when people are speaking authentically to you. And what that told me was Middlebury is a place where not only do people’s names matter, but just the individual life behind that name matters. And I try to pay attention to that.\n\n\n\nHeadwinds and Opportunities\n\n\n\nWe are at a moment that has been building for some time, in which what had been part of an American social contract and the place of higher education in an American social contract is, I wouldn’t say, unraveled. But it’s in the process of maybe unraveling. The way that I think about that is that we, so this we, the college is broader than the American we. The college is a global we, but for the moment, just want to think about an American we. An American we, really from the middle of the 20th Century onwards has been built beginning with something like the signing of the GI Bill, by the opening of the door of opportunity and privilege that was located for centuries in our institutions of higher education, which had slowly and gradually begun to open their doors, but truly not dramatically and not comprehensively. And something happens with the signing of the GI Bill. There’s a recognition of the service—and this is still men at this point primarily—but the service of those men who fought in the second World War, and a recognition that the nation needed to do something to recognize that service. And the GI Bill is signed, and with the signing of the GI Bill, I see that as this marked moment in the history of American democracy and with higher education playing the role of saying, we are going to widen the door of opportunity, and we’re going to take this notion that’s been at the heart of the idea of the republic since our founding, the idea of we, we the people, the people who hold certain truths to be self-evident, that all are created equal. And to begin to live the truth of that promise, and to say that it is higher education that will do so. And you get from that moment on through the courageous struggle and conviction of generations of people, a gradual widening and opening of this, the GI Bill, the Civil Rights movements, the women’s rights movements, the movements for LGBTQ+ rights, this constant opening, and the opening is often contested, but the reason that it’s contested is that there’s an understanding that key to the possibility of full participation in the life of our democracy is access to higher education. And that becomes part of our social contract.\n\n\n\nIf I see a challenge, it is that there is no longer a consensus that access to the full freedom and possibility of higher education is necessary to the flourishing of our democracy. This receives valences through particular political campaigns, it receives valences through particular movements. There are principled people who will disagree about particulars. But if I see a challenge, that’s the core challenge. The opportunity is that when something around which there has been a consensus is questioned, those of us who’ve shared the consensus understand that we need to argue again. And we should seek the good in that, because it means that if we have become in any way not as crisp, not as dedicated, not as clear in our thinking about the value of what it is that we do, then we must find a way to name that again. And so, when I say that I don’t think that it is unraveled, I don’t think, I don’t have a sense of loss. I grew up, and we’ve talked about this, I grew up in Apartheid South Africa, and I saw history change. And that childhood experience has left me with a profound sense of optimism, of historical optimism, a real sense of optimism because it cost people their lives. But history can change. I have the good fortune to be at a university where Dr. King came to speak. And while he did not say these words at the University of Virginia when he spoke, at this campus, among Dr. King’s words that I hold most powerfully, is that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. The arc of American higher education is long, and it bends toward the promise of democracy. And we have the opportunity to participate in the bending of the arc of history.\n\n\n\n“I Can’t Wait”\n\n\n\nHow do I feel? Uh, exhilarated. I cannot wait to get going. And I feel humbled. And I’ve learned something about humility, which is that it’s not a statement about yourself, it’s a statement about being in the presence of something that is greater than yourself. And I have that, I have a sense of what a treasure Middlebury is, and I just feel humbled and excited, incredibly grateful. And I just cannot wait to get started. I’m not coming to Middlebury to be president.\n\n\n\nI’m coming to be your president.",

    "content": "UPDATE, 10:36 a.m. January 29: We have just received word, a couple of minutes ago, that the Trump administration has rescinded the executive order that froze federal assistance including grants and loans, mentioned in the memo sent this morning. We welcome this news. The College will continue to monitor developments that might impact the SMC community.\n\nDear SMC Colleagues & Students:\n\nThese are uncertain times, with sweeping changes taking place at the federal level. Following the release of a memo from the White House budget office on January 27 about a potential pause in financial assistance, many institutions and agencies across the nation have been scrambling to evaluate the potential implications. We are waiting on guidance from federal granting agencies on how this memo will affect federal grants issued to Santa Monica College—the memo addresses federal agencies, not SMC—and will share that information when we receive it.\n\nHere is what we know right now: The federal financial aid SMC students are eligible for is still active and being provided per usual processes. The US Department of Education has officially confirmed that federal Pell grants and student loans will not be impacted.\n\nYesterday, a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration’s executive action ruling that courts need more time to consider the far-reaching ramifications. Santa Monica College continues to collaborate closely with the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office and other partners to assess the impact of this and other executive orders on our college community.\n\nPlease continue to monitor your SMC email for further updates; any future news and guidance that impact the college community and regular business operations will be shared as promptly as possible. This college stands firm in its commitment to maintaining a safe, dynamic, and inclusive environment, where each individual matters—irrespective of immigration status, race, ethnicity, national origin, sexuality, gender, religion, ability, age, or socio-economic status.\n\nWe appreciate your patience as we face this evolving situation. Together, we will get through whatever lies ahead.\n\nKathryn E. Jeffery\n\nSMC Superintendent/President",

Your steadfast commitment to supporting SMC students and each other truly embodies the spirit of Santa Monica College. “SMC Cares” has proven to be more than a slogan—it is a way of being, of demonstrating that in times of great adversity, this community shows up for each other, and those who need our help. In the face of immense challenges brought on by these devastating wildfires, SMC faculty, classified professionals, and managers have risen to the occasion to ensure that instruction continues, vital services and business operations remain accessible to our community, and SMC students remain on track to fulfill their goals.\n\nWe understand the significant impact the wildfires have had on our SMC community, and steps have been taken to better comprehend and address those challenges. A survey was recently sent to students and employees to assess the wildfires’ effects, and we have also engaged in intentional outreach to those impacted. Tragically, some have lost their homes, and we are actively working to connect them with local resources and support services. If you or someone you know needs assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to your supervisor or a trusted campus contact. We are here for you.\n\nI also understand there are concerns about the smell of smoke and the presence of ash. Please rest assured that the health, safety, and well-being of our SMC community remain our highest priority. SMC has protocols for supporting healthy air quality on campus during a wildfire scenario and those extra measures have been taken by our Maintenance and Operations team. We have been closely monitoring overall conditions throughout each day, and our campuses remain within a safe range for the Air Quality Index (AQI). Additionally, HVAC equipment at all campuses use MERV 13 Filters and have been running 24/7 to ensure that indoor environments remain safe. For any outdoor activities or travel, you may request surgical, KN95 and N95 masks at the Receiving Department, between 7 a.m.- 2:30 p.m. If you require an N95 mask, please complete the attached form and bring it with you to the Receiving Department when picking up your mask. Departments can also continue to order masks for the department through Adobe Sign.\n\nWe encourage anyone with concerns or needs for additional support to speak directly with their supervisor. Your health, safety, and well-being matter to us. Thank you for your continued dedication to SMC’s mission during this challenging time. Please take care of yourselves, stay safe, and, if you are able, assist with relief efforts in your area. We will get through the days ahead, together.\n\nKathryn E.

    "content": "Dear JHU Community,\n\nAs federal actions and directives on a wide range of issues continue to impact our university directly—from the termination and slowing of research grants to policy changes on immigration, diversity, and accreditation—we remain keenly focused on our mission and our shared responsibility to our students, staff, and faculty.\n\nIn this challenging moment for higher education and for Johns Hopkins in particular, we write to share several updates with the community, including important developments affecting our international students and the launch of support programs for our faculty, staff, and students.\n\nImmigration and our international community\n\nWe are encouraged by the news on Friday that the federal government has decided to restore the visas of foreign students nationwide. As of today, 36 of the 37 Johns Hopkins international students and recent graduates whose SEVIS records were terminated by the government have had their status reactivated. Our Office of International Services (OIS) and Office of General Counsel (OGC) are continuing to provide services to affected students, including pursuing reinstatement, access to legal representation, and as needed support to return to campus.\n\nTo keep our community apprised of developments, we will hold a second Community Update: Immigration and Visas on Tuesday, April 29, at noon. Please visit the OIS website for more information.\n\nResearch impacts\n\nWe shared with you previously the severe impact of the government’s cancellation of international aid grants for our divisions working around the globe. While a portion of those USAID grants have since been restored, we have also experienced terminations of research grants from a number of other federal agencies. To date, more than 100 federal research grants have been canceled universitywide and many others are experiencing delays in renewals, awards, or reviews.\n\nWe are continuing to take a prudent and measured approach to planning for the financial impacts of these actions. We must gird for more cuts ahead given proposals in Washington for dramatic reductions in federal research budgets and continued debate over the shared funding of the facilities and administrative costs (F&A or “indirect” costs) essential to our research. We are working closely with the divisions to plan for various contingencies in this highly fluid policy environment. We are in touch with those faculty and staff who are affected directly by immediate terminations, and we will continue to update the community as we move forward. We remain in this work together, as one university, and our planning is focused on how we balance support for our core academic functions with potential reductions in funding that are likely to have a longer and deeper impact on our budgets, personnel, and programs.\n\nAs you know, we joined with peer universities and the Association of American Universities (AAU) in litigation aimed at halting sudden cuts to existing NIH grants. This suit is wending its way through the courts and has thus far been successful in preventing the immediate loss of an estimated $4 billion dollars in annual research funding for higher education institutions, of which Johns Hopkins’ share is approximately $200 million. We anticipate joining similar legal actions should additional federal agencies seek to pull back other large-scale federal funding commitments, reflecting our resolve to exercise our rights to due process and fair treatment as needed.\n\nWe are also supporting the AAU and other organizations’ advocacy efforts on multiple fronts to make the case for the staggering success of the research compact between the federal government and our universities, and the dire effects for America that would result from its contraction or dismantling.\n\nIn addition, we are reviewing the recent imposition of new terms and conditions on all NIH grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. As this community has heard from us before, the laws and regulations that protect against discrimination of any kind are well established, and we are scrupulous in following them for the benefit of every member of our community. Johns Hopkins fiercely opposes discrimination and welcomes people of diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and thought as essential to the effective discharge of our truth-seeking function, and we will pursue these values consistent with the U.S. Constitution and applicable federal laws and regulations.\n\nSupport programs for our research community\n\nWe are deeply committed to sustaining the people and projects that power discovery at Johns Hopkins.While we cannot make up the full measure of recent or potential federal research cuts, we are striving to provide several new supports to faculty, students, and staff directly affected in an effort to temper some of the most immediate impacts on our research enterprise.\n\nThese investments include:\n\nPivot and Bridge Grant Programs : Together with divisional leadership, the university is establishing pivot and bridge grants to provide short-term funding for faculty members and research teams facing grant terminations or significant delays in grant awards. These new grants will allow affected researchers to pivot to new research directions and/or funding sources or to bridge their research programs pending sponsored funding. Full details—including deadlines, eligibility criteria, and application instructions, plus information about additional faculty support programs—are available on the Office of the Vice Provost for Research website.\n\n: Together with divisional leadership, the university is establishing pivot and bridge grants to provide short-term funding for faculty members and research teams facing grant terminations or significant delays in grant awards.

Editorial Assistance Services Initiative (EASI) : Established in 2021, EASI offers editorial support for grant proposals and journal articles at no charge. This popular service has expanded its pool of writers to serve more faculty members of all ranks and in all fields during this period of transition to new federal funding priorities and alternative funding sources.\n\nEstablished in 2021, EASI offers editorial support for grant proposals and journal articles at no charge.

PhD Thesis and Postdoc Research Completion Program: This initiative offers one year of support to PhD students whose dissertations are impacted by recent changes in federal grants and to postdoctoral fellows who had been supported by federal grants that were terminated.

Summer Provost’s Undergraduate Research Awards (PURA): Given the impact of federal research cuts on summer research and internship opportunities, and to enable even more undergraduates to pursue original research and creative projects in collaboration with Hopkins mentors, we have increased university funding for the PURAprogram for Summer 2025, raising from 66 to 113 the number of funded students at Hopkins.\n\nThese investments, and our intensive ongoing planning and advocacy, reflect our firm commitment to preserving the essential work of both basic and applied discovery, to continuing to honor our core values as America’s first research university, especially academic freedom, and to protecting our people, particularly those whose work and livelihoods are dependent upon federal support. Sustaining our mission and each other in this environment stands as our lodestar. We will continue to defend our mission vigorously, affirming and reaffirming our steadfast belief and confidence in how our work has and will contribute to the wellbeing and strength of our country and the world.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRonald Daniels\n\nPresident\n\nRay Jayawardhana\n\nProvost\n\nProfessor of Physics and Astronomy",

    "content": "Dear Johns Hopkins Community:\n\nJohns Hopkins holds a particular place in the firmament of American, indeed, international higher education. Founded in the nation’s centennial year, Johns Hopkins became America’s first research university. A place dedicated to the creation of new knowledge and to the dissemination of that knowledge to our students and the world beyond.\n\nIn the ensuing nearly 150 years, we have not wavered from our foundational commitment to the research ideal. Research is our hallmark, and its essential instruments—freedom of inquiry and expression, academic excellence, marshaling of evidence, rigorous and open debate, and an embrace of diverse backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints—form our core values.\n\nCritical to our success has been our more than eight-decade partnership with the federal government. The funds allocated by the federal government on a competitive, meritocratic basis to us and other American research universities have extended and improved the quality of human life, driven innovation, educated the next generation, created new industries and jobs, ensured the safety of the nation, and fueled the remarkable success and productivity of the American economy.\n\nFor this reason, the unprecedented challenges and pointed uncertainties of the current moment for research universities are perplexing and distressing. Over the past six weeks, we have experienced a fast and far-reaching cascade of executive orders and agency actions affecting higher education and federally sponsored research. What began as stop work orders or pauses in grant funding allocations has morphed into cancellations and terminations. Grant reviews at various agencies have been suspended, which means that grant applications submitted by our colleagues are not being evaluated or recommended for funding in a timely fashion. We anticipate that in the coming months we will see other areas where federal actions may result in a significant reduction in research work, though at this time, we are not certain of their scope and magnitude.\n\nBecause of our researchers’ extraordinary success in competing year after year for merit-based grants and contracts, we are, more than any other American university, deeply tethered to the compact between our sector and the federal government. Last year, for instance, nearly 50% of our total incoming funds was derived from research conducted on behalf of the federal government. The breadth and depth of this historic relationship means that cuts to federal research will affect research faculty, students, and staff and will ripple through our university.\n\nGiven what we are seeing, it is necessary to plan for challenges ahead. We are, as always, in this together, and we will need a systemwide approach to address whatever systemwide shocks we and our university peers may sustain.\n\nAs we shared with you previously, Johns Hopkins is participating in litigation aimed at halting cuts to existing NIH grants. While we are awaiting the disposition of that case, we will continue to advocate to our elected representatives for the tremendous impact of the longstanding research partnership between universities and the federal government, and for the principles and values undergirding our mission.\n\nHowever, at this time, we have little choice but to reduce some of our work in response to the slowing and stopping of grants and to adjust to an evolving legal landscape. There are difficult moments before us, with impacts to budgets, personnel, and programs. Some will take time to fully understand and address; others will happen more quickly.\n\nFor our colleagues involved with medical and public health work around the globe, the unexpected stoppage of foreign aid funds has resulted in the suspension and now termination of most of our USAID grant portfolio at Jhpiego, the Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Communication Programs, and the School of Medicine, which totals more than $800 million. Because of these funding terminations, we are in the process of winding down USAID grant-related activities in Baltimore and internationally, including impactful work to provide maternal and infant care, prevent the spread of diseases, and provide clean drinking water.\n\nIn response to these developments and other challenges on the horizon, we are taking thoughtful steps to reduce expenses and to budget prudently, while avoiding any precipitous actions. Our finance team is working closely with deans and divisional budget officers to develop various scenarios for potential funding reductions and to assess the effects on all aspects of our operations. Our aim is to focus on our mission, to double and re-double our commitment to excellence, to be thoughtful and transparent in our planning and budgeting, and to consult with our shared governance bodies. We will communicate more with you as these contingency planning efforts develop.\n\nWe are taking a similar approach to understanding other administration directives, including those involving diversity, equity, and inclusion. At Hopkins, we have long sought to model the best of a vibrant pluralist community. We aspire to be a place that fiercely opposes discrimination, supports equality of opportunity, and welcomes diverse people, perspectives, and thought as essential to the effective discharge of our truth-seeking function.\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in SFFA v. Harvard and other legal precedents, we believe the law is clear in supporting the pursuit of this pluralistic ideal, and in protecting the exercise of free speech and academic freedom in classrooms, curricula, and scholarly inquiry. The laws and regulations that protect against discrimination of any kind are also clear, and we are scrupulous in following them for the benefit of every member of our community. After the SFFA decision, we undertook a review of our current policies and programs, including our admissions processes, and made modifications to ensure compliance with the court’s decision. Our Office of General Counsel will continue to advise us regarding any further adjustments needed to ensure the constitutionality of our activities.\n\nAs we have been in the past, we are resolute in our commitment to facing the challenges before us together as one university. We will continue to advocate vigorously and passionately for the importance of our community’s work, to protect the flame of rational inquiry and debate that burns so brightly here at Hopkins, and to be guided by our mission and the excellence, conviction, and humanity of each of you.\n\nThis ethos has carried us through daunting challenges of the past. Time and again, we have met the moment, sought new opportunities, and charted our course forward with determination and vision. We will do so again, and as we enter our 150th year, this must be our solemn pledge and commitment to one another.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRon",

    "content": "Dear Johns Hopkins Community:\n\nWe are writing today to inform you that Johns Hopkins University has joined the Association of American Universities (AAU), the American Council on Education (ACE), the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities (APLU), and 12 of our peer research universities in filing a lawsuit in federal court to block deep and devastating cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding that were announced on Friday evening. We learned this evening that in a separate, but similar case against the NIH, a temporary restraining order was granted in 22 states, including Maryland. Barring this judicial intervention, an immediate cut to the reimbursement of NIH’s share of costs associated with our research would have taken effect today.\n\nThese abrupt and sweeping cuts in NIH funding pose an extraordinary challenge to the important and lifesaving work of our faculty, staff, and students at Johns Hopkins. They jeopardize the longstanding and remarkable research partnership that was forged between the federal government and higher education at the conclusion of WWII, and put at risk the future of the American research enterprise as a whole.\n\nThe particular category of funds that is being targeted for dramatic cuts are referred to as indirect costs or F&A (facilities and administration). Indirect costs include equipment and instrumentation, laboratories, safety measures, IT infrastructure, and expert personnel who support research. These funds quite literally keep the lights on, ensure that high-powered computing systems can crunch data, and allow our staff to maintain clean, safe, and efficient labs. For decades, the NIH has reimbursed us for a portion of these research costs, based on a preset and agreed-upon contractual rate.\n\nGiven that these costs are an essential part of the research enterprise, dramatic cuts to the reimbursement formula cannot help but force corresponding cuts to research. It is that simple.\n\nWe could point to any number of examples of how these dramatic cuts will impact our research and patient care mission, but let us offer just one: NIH funding supports approximately 600 current and ongoing clinical trials at Johns Hopkins. This includes open clinical trials in cancer, pediatrics and children’s health, heart and vascular studies, and the aging brain, among many others. The NIH funding cut endangers these trials and many more like them into the future. And these trial participants are our patients. The care, treatments, and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not “overhead” – they offer meaningful hope and scientific expertise, often when it’s needed most. They are the lifeblood of the advanced care that draws patients from across the country and around the world to Johns Hopkins. Many of them come to us with life threatening conditions or diseases that have failed to respond to treatment elsewhere. They come to us because of our commitment to connecting our research with the very best clinical care.\n\nThis is why we joined the suit filed today by the AAU.\n\nAt Johns Hopkins we have long relied on and planned for the future based on that federal funding commitment, as well as our faculty members’ exceptional success in the highly competitive and rigorous NIH peer review process. We fully understand the responsibility placed on us to uphold the public trust and serve as thoughtful stewards of these funds. But the fact is that if the NIH stops funding its share of these costs, much of this important research will be jeopardized.\n\nWe know that this news out of NIH, along with other recent or anticipated impacts on areas of our work, has caused tremendous anxiety among our faculty, staff and students. Our offices of the General Counsel and Finance and Administration, along with university and divisional leadership, have been working at a breakneck pace and with great determination to make the case for the important work you do and to understand and prepare for the serious financial impacts of this cut.\n\nYour work is at the heart of the compact between America’s research universities and our government, in service to our fellow citizens and the nation. We will continue to advocate for and support your exceptional work, and to preserve the excellence and mission of our university.\n\nWe will communicate with the university community as this situation evolves and share information through your divisions, JHURA, ORA, and the Guidance for Researchers website.\n\nThank you for the work you do to advance human understanding and keep our loved ones and the patients and families we serve healthy and safe.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRon Daniels\n\nPresident\n\nTheodore L. DeWeese, M.D.\n\nDean of the Medical Faculty\n\nCEO, Johns Hopkins Medicine",

    "content": "Dear Johns Hopkins Community:\n\nAs America’s first research university, Johns Hopkins has had a longstanding and highly productive partnership with our federal government, forged in the embers of WWII when Vannevar Bush—an MIT engineering professor and the renowned leader of wartime R&D who went on to found the National Science Foundation—was called upon to redeploy the American research enterprise for “the improvement of the national health, the creation of new enterprises bringing jobs, and the betterment of the national standard of living.”\n\nIn the ensuing years, universities all across America answered that call, producing research and discoveries that have transformed our understanding of the possible—from the invention of radar systems to GPS, from modern genetics to quantum mechanics, from the development of the pacemaker to cancer immunotherapy. University-based research, supported by the federal government, has time and again advanced American ingenuity and competitiveness and improved the human condition at home and across the globe.\n\nNow, as a new administration arrives in Washington, research universities are being called upon to navigate a period of substantial change, and we are reminded that this federal partnership is not to be taken lightly.\n\nIn just the past two weeks, we have seen numerous executive orders, agency directives, and other federal actions that directly affect our university’s research mission. These actions and communications signal changes in federal policy with regard to foreign aid, patient care, public health, diversity, gender, and immigration, and they coincide with unexpected pauses in grant payments from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), National Science Foundation (NSF), and National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nThe pace and scope of this transition is intense and presents a challenge for our university community, as it does for all of the American research enterprise.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the evolving federal landscape and collaborating closely with divisional leaders to assess and prepare for the implications of these changes across the full range of disciplines and programs, and we will continue to seek the partnership of our shared governance bodies. We are also hearing from you about your desire to continue the critical work of discovery, education, and patient care. Your commitment to improving and saving lives, pursuing the next discovery, and advancing opportunity is both inspiring and unsurprising—this is what Johns Hopkins and its people do.\n\nAnd so, I write you today to urge you to keep doing your important work.\n\nIt will take some time before we know and can provide clear guidance on the extent of the changes before us. Unless you have received specific direction from an agency to pause your work, and verification of that from our Office of General Counsel, carry on. For those of you who have received direct federal communications, our Office of General Counsel and academic leadership will provide guidance and support.\n\nJohns Hopkins has long positioned itself financially to weather short-term disruptions in federal funding, but we are also anticipating some longer-term curtailment of activities. We will comply fully with any changes in federal laws and requirements, and we will continue to do our work and highlight its positive impact while we await clarity on those changes from the federal government and through the judicial review process.\n\nIndeed, on the cusp of our 150th anniversary, we’ll continue to do the work that has defined our institution since our beginning—to bring the benefits of discovery to the world, open students’ minds to new ideas, care for patients who rely on us, and explore ways to better understand the human condition and find solutions to society’s great challenges. And in this work, we will be guided by the principles of excellence, ingenuity, and open inquiry, drawing on the rich tapestry of people, thought, and experience that we have long held to be essential to our success.\n\nThank you for the role you play in Johns Hopkins’ extraordinary academic community. We will stay in touch as we move forward together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRon Daniels",

I am humbled by the statement of support by our Board of Trustees, and also by the many of you—faculty, staff, students, alumni, and parents—who have reached out with words of encouragement and care.\n\nAt the same time, I recognize that there are decisions that I and my team could have approached differently. As a community of educators, we seek to learn from these experiences, and I always welcome your comments and feedback as we strive to make this College strong in service to our students and the community. I have carefully read the motion of the faculty and its supporting documents. While I disagree with many of the assertions put forward in the motion, some of which I addressed at Tuesday’s meeting, I know that the concerns come from people who are deeply committed to this College and its future.\n\nDespite our disagreements, we share the common bond of caring for Lafayette. It is from this place of shared purpose that I invite us to move forward together.\n\nIn that spirit, I am encouraged that we are formally initiating constructive conversations between faculty, administration, and Trustees that will intentionally ensure the College maintains its strong commitment to shared governance and rightful standing as one of the best liberal arts colleges in the country.\n\nThe College is strong across its finances, enrollment, academic programs, and planning efforts. Even from this position of strength, however, we also face the many challenges the rest of higher education does. We will only thrive in our third century if we face these challenges together.\n\nThough there are obstacles ahead, I am extremely optimistic about the future of Lafayette College. As I told the faculty this week, my optimism comes from what I know to be true after my three and a half years as your president.\n\nI know and respect the power, dedication, and excellence of our world-class faculty, who are exceptional teacher-scholars and provide invaluable service to the College. I am grateful both to our long-serving faculty who have built this vibrant institution, and to our new colleagues who are bringing their talents and scholarship to their classrooms, research, and creative activities.\n\nI know the commitment of our talented staff who support our campus community, from caring for the well-being of our students and staff to the stewardship of our technology, buildings, and grounds so we can deliver a world-class education.\n\nI know the curiosity, passion, and creativity of our students, who are prepared by our dedicated faculty and staff to live lives of impact, transformed by the education they receive here.\n\nI know the deep pride and commitment held by our Trustees and the more than 30,000 alumni who think of Lafayette as a place to lift up, invest in, and call home.\n\nAnd finally, I know that, when we come together, we are a beacon in these challenging times—an inspiring exemplar of the power of a liberal arts education.\n\nI look forward to what we will do together.\n\nOn Lafayette!\n\nPresident Nicole Hurd",

    "content": "Dear Lafayette Community,\n\nBill, Monica, Matthew, and I send our best wishes to you and yours for a happy new year!\n\nAs we enter a new semester and the start of the year in which we will begin our bicentennial celebration, let us first take an opportunity to reflect on the many accomplishments of our community in 2024. As an institution committed to academic excellence, we continue to attract exceptional students, faculty, and staff, and most recently, we received the largest number of applicants ever in our Early Decision 1 pool for the Class of 2029. The Enrollment team is working tirelessly to build upon this early success through the entirety of the enrollment season, and we are grateful for their efforts\n\nOur faculty are leaders in both their teaching and scholarship, and our students and staff continue to be recognized for their contributions across the Lehigh Valley, the Commonwealth, the nation, and around the globe. These accomplishments inspire national attention, with the College receiving notable accolades from Washington Monthly and the Princeton Review, among others, and a ranking of 3rd among liberal arts colleges in the northeast in the most recent Wall Street Journal poll. The College also benefits greatly from our alumni, who are leading lives of consequence and impact in a number of sectors, including here on College Hill, where Jennifer Stone ’04 led the field hockey team to a Patriot League Championship.\n\nThrough our planning work, we developed a new mission statement and institutional values together, and advanced on our strategic and campus master plans. Our development efforts brought record participation and contributions during “Bring the Roar” and have set us up for the largest campaign in College history. From boardrooms to classrooms, from scholarship and field work to athletics and artistic performances, the Lafayette community is leading in exciting ways.\n\nAs we begin 2025, our bicentennial is an incredible opportunity to celebrate our history while amplifying the College’s reputation and preparing for our third century. For more than 16 months, task forces of students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents, and neighbors have been working on assembling plans to mark the College’s enduring record of education, service, and leadership. Activities will begin during Fall Weekend, September 26-28, and you can review our latest plans and find continuing updates on the bicentennial website. As part of the celebration, this semester we will launch a “Third Century Conversations” series in which we will engage faculty, alumni, and leaders in discussing the College’s contributions to addressing critical issues of the day. It is always inspiring to engage with our Lafayette family as we elevate their scholarship, leadership, and service. To kick off the series, we look forward to welcoming Chip Bergh ’79 to our first conversation in the coming weeks.\n\nIn addition to celebrating this important milestone, we will also spend time this year exploring issues critical to the health, success, and continued strength of the College. This semester we will be launching “Forward Together,” a series of discussions on campus designed to engage our community on topics important to the future of Lafayette. As higher education navigates the headwinds we all know well, we look forward to sharing the College’s approach to facing these challenges through vital aspects of our work in such areas as the operating budget, enrollment planning, strategic priorities, endowment objectives, and advancement–work that will strengthen our infrastructure and ensure Lafayette remains a leader in liberal arts education. Together, we will advance our shared commitment to academic excellence and a strong, vibrant future for the College.\n\nWe enter 2025 with a great sense of pride in what we have accomplished as a community and excitement for the opportunities ahead. Whether through our exceptional students, faculty, and staff or the engagement of our alumni, Lafayette will continue to be a beacon for the power of a liberal arts education. I extend my special thanks to everyone whose creativity and dedication will advance our strategic priorities and goals, lift up the College during our bicentennial, and carry forward the excellence that distinguishes this community of learning.\n\nMay the year ahead bring love, joy, and peace.\n\nOn Lafayette–to great things ahead!\n\nYours,\n\nPresident Nicole Hurd",

    "content": "Dear Pomona College Community,\n\nCongratulations on the successful conclusion of the teaching term yesterday. I wish our students well as they head into final exams.\n\nAs we approach the celebratory part of the academic year, I want to update you on the latest federal developments, consistent with my updates throughout this semester. Next week, I will be sharing a fuller update of College progress this spring and, then, in the weeks ahead, I will share an update on progress and latest developments in the College’s work to achieve our strategic vision.\n\nHere are the latest issues emerging from Capitol Hill related to higher education and how the College is responding:\n\nUnited Front with Colleges and University Partners\n\nWe continue to convey the College’s concerns about ongoing federal policy decisions to representatives and staff on Capitol Hill.\n\nOur alarm around threats to higher education and academic freedom led President Starr and I to join with presidents from hundreds of other colleges and universities across the country in signing a recent open letter to our government, “A Call for Constructive Engagement.”\n\nIn April, the College signed on to an amicus brief led by the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration. This brief supported a motion, which the federal court ultimately approved, requesting a preliminary court order enjoining the White House from acting on its new policy of revoking the visas of and arresting, detaining and deporting noncitizen students and faculty exercising their rights to free speech and free association. We will continue to advocate for these Constitutional rights. The attacks on such rights, like the administration’s deeply troubling attacks on academic freedom, run contrary to values at the foundation of America and, in fact, to values central to our College.\n\nAt the state level, we continue to work with the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities (AICCU) to engage with California lawmakers on issues critical to higher education. Last month, I joined other AICCU college presidents in meetings with state legislators, including to discuss state budget priorities for college students.\n\nFederal Endowment Tax\n\nAs you know, one of the continuing issues being debated in Congress is increasing the federal tax on endowments of nonprofit colleges and universities whose endowment per student exceeds $500,000, which includes Pomona. As shared previously, since this tax was introduced in 2017, the cost to Pomona has been more than $16 million, which is roughly equivalent to 184 full student scholarships. As part of the emerging budget package, the Republican majority in both houses of Congress is discussing increasing the current 1.4% tax rate to between 10% and 21%, a dramatic increase that would impact both the College’s operations and the endowment. We are working closely with peer institutions through the Small Colleges Coalition to express to Congressional offices the negative impact such increases would have on the College’s investment of endowment resources in financial aid and other essential aspects of our educational mission. In addition, we are working to convey this concern through our own Washington, D.C. contacts and our higher education consortia, including the American Council on Education and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.\n\nWe also recognize that other institutions, including Harvard, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, Brown, and others, are facing different challenges from the current administration. These challenges include the administration’s series of announcements that it is withholding hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars in federal funding that had been allocated to those universities for research and other critical programs. While Pomona’s faculty are recipients of some federal grants, the College’s budget does not depend on federal investments like those other institutions.\n\nPomona community members have shared with us their own concerns about the potential impact of Executive Orders and other federal decisions on the College’s finances. While the decisions that Congress might ultimately make remain quite unclear, and the most extreme outcomes being discussed would create severe budget challenges for Pomona, I want to stress that we are prepared to adapt our budget to meet a wide range of outcomes from the above decisions. We do not receive much federal funding, donors to the College across generations and strong investment performance have enhanced our endowment, and Pomona has practiced careful budget management across the years. For the 2026 academic year, we have prepared well, including by identifying savings initiatives, and expect the College’s budget to be stable as we face this period of uncertainty around federal funding and tax-policy discussions.\n\nNational Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Budget Cuts\n\nWe are tremendously proud of our faculty leaders in research, some of whom have earned competitively awarded grants from these two important agencies of U.S. competitiveness. We are paying close attention to Congressional discussions that could drastically reduce these agencies’ budgets and staff. As you probably know, the administration has already made large funding and staffing cuts to these and other federal agencies that are vital to America’s world-leading research system.\n\nLate last week, the NSF announced that it has stopped issuing new grants, and it has so far cancelled more than 1,000 current grants. Hundreds of research and service grants and contracts at the NIH, Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency also have been canceled. None of these decisions has yet resulted in cuts to grants to Pomona.\n\nThe emerging budget and appropriations discussions propose even more significant cuts to these and other science and research agencies, and we are working through every possible channel to convey our views about the harm these reductions would cause for America’s world leadership, its recruitment and development of great talent from across the globe, and the future of American science, medicine and innovation.\n\nFor questions and guidance on federal funding, please reach out to Dean Gerstein, director of sponsored research.\n\nInternational Student Updates\n\nOn April 25, Dean of Students Avis Hinkson and Dean of the College Melanie Wu provided a timely update on a number of matters related to international students, including summer research funding, employment and housing. Thank you to all who have stepped up by posting summer opportunities for our students on Handshake.\n\nIf students are still looking for summer opportunities, please reach out to Dean Hinkson or Dean Wu.\n\nI am relieved to note that shortly after that message was sent on April 25, colleges and universities across the country, including the Claremont Colleges, began seeing the restoration of records of international students who are part of the federal government’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses the SEVIS system to manage student and exchange-visitor records. Prior to April 25, international students had begun receiving notices that their SEVIS records had been terminated or their visas revoked without warning or clear explanation. We are pleased that these issues have been corrected and that students’ SEVIS status has been restored, as SEVIS status is a critical part of the system that allows international students to study in the U.S. For students who have questions about their documentation or guidelines, please reach out to Kathy Quispe, who has performed truly heroic service in support of our international students.\n\nWe will continue to keep you informed as these and other policy developments unfold. I look forward to sharing with you next week a summary of some of the most positive work done across the College this semester. As we prepare to celebrate our Class of 2025 at Commencement, I wish all our students, faculty and staff a productive and successful conclusion to the academic year.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines\n\nActing President\n\nEdwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "Dear Pomona College community,\n\nAs you know, on March 27 the College received a letter jointly signed by the chairs of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce and its Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development requesting certain information from the College by April 10. As I have shared in prior related updates, since receiving this letter, we have been working with legal counsel and other advisors to fully understand every aspect of the committee’s request.\n\nDiscussions with committee representatives have produced an amended timeline for the College’s response to the committee. Specifically, we will be responding to their request in several parts over the next few weeks. Yesterday, consistent with that revised timeline, we provided the committee with the first part of our response, which was information related to the September 2024 protest incident at the President’s House. Our response made clear that this incident did not result in any disciplinary actions. And let me stress that, consistent with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (commonly called FERPA), no identifying information of any kind about individual students was shared with the committee.\n\nAs we complete our obligations to the committee over the coming weeks, we will continue to ensure that we uphold Pomona’s mission and values and protect the privacy of our students.\n\nIn legal investigations the College protects the confidentiality of the related materials at all times. We therefore will not be sharing our responses to the committee beyond the committee itself.\n\nI will share another update with you on this matter in a few weeks, after we provide the final material to the committee on the revised timeline.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines\n\nActing President\n\nEdwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

If you’re on campus, I hope you enjoy the many activities that ASPC and the Wellness Taskforce have prepared for our campus today. I encourage you to come together as a community to find joy with each other on our College’s special day celebrating Pomona’s favorite number 47.\n\nConsistent with my commitment to keeping you informed as best as we can, I also reach out today with a brief update on several matters that have surfaced over the last few days related to the College and higher education nationally:\n\nInternational Students : As you may know, news emerged over the weekend that the State Department revoked visas for a number of international students in California in the past week. If decisions like this impact any Pomona students, our Office of International Student Services will work closely with them however possible to provide guidance and advice. If you are an international student who has related questions, please see the resource guide for international students or contact Kathy Guillén Quispe directly.\n\n: As you may know, news emerged over the weekend that the State Department revoked visas for a number of international students in California in the past week.

If you are an international student who has related questions, please see the resource guide for international students or contact Kathy Guillén Quispe directly. NEH Grants : Last week, the administration made devastating cuts in funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) that impacted, among many other areas, faculty NEH research awards, including grants that several of our own faculty members had earned in highly competitive NEH grants processes. The College is fortunate to have accumulated spendable gift balances, including in department-held restricted gift funds, that could be used to support faculty research projects. We encourage impacted faculty to discuss their continuous research needs with the chairs of their department. For guidance regarding external funding agencies, please reach out to Dean Gerstein.\n\n: Last week, the administration made devastating cuts in funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) that impacted, among many other areas, faculty NEH research awards, including grants that several of our own faculty members had earned in highly competitive NEH grants processes.

NIH Grants : We are also closely monitoring news regarding National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants. Attorneys general from 15 states recently filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts against the Department of Health and Human Services and the NIH for terminating grants to public research institutions and delaying the review and funding of grant applications; those grants include several earned by our faculty in the NIH’s own highly competitive grants process. We are encouraged by related news, though: In a similar case filed in the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island against the termination of grants from NIH-adjacent agencies (i.e., the Centers for Disease Control and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services), a judge has just issued a Temporary Restraining Order that reverses those grant cuts. We are hopeful that a decision in the Massachusetts case will result in a similar decision so that our faculty’s NIH grants can be restarted soon.\n\n: We are also closely monitoring news regarding National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants.

Later this month, I will join other AICCU college presidents to meet with state legislators and discuss state budget priorities for college students.\n\nToday I want to share the latest information we have on the following:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE): As you are likely aware, in January, President Trump authorized ICE to enter public spaces on college and university campuses to pursue enforcement actions. Previously, ICE had been prohibited from doing so.\n\nSince my last campus comprehensive update a couple of weeks ago, ICE has carried out enforcement actions on or near the campuses of numerous universities across the country. We are following these matters closely, including the questions being raised about the legality of several of those arrests. We are working with appropriate contacts and higher education associations to convey our views on these matters.\n\nWe are unaware of any such enforcement actions having occurred at any of the Claremont colleges, including Pomona. We know that inaccurate rumors have circulated, and I understand that this type of misinformation can be highly distressing. I assure you that if we learn of ICE’s having conducted any enforcement action at Pomona, we will inform you of that fact. I also want to assure you that should such actions develop, the College will do everything in its power to protect each and every student’s legal rights.\n\nI remind you that we have provided related protocol information and FAQs about steps to take if such enforcement actions occur at Pomona. We continue to update that material as new information emerges. (To access this material, log in to the my.pomona.edu portal.)\n\nResources for International Students: I want to highlight the excellent work by our Office of International Student Services led by Kathy Guillen Quispe. She has been a critical support for our international students, current and incoming, as well as our recent graduates with Optional Practical Training (OPT) work authorization. For more information please see the resource guide for international students or contact Kathy Quispe directly.\n\nI want to highlight the excellent work by our Office of International Student Services led by Kathy Guillen Quispe. She has been a critical support for our international students, current and incoming, as well as our recent graduates with Optional Practical Training (OPT) work authorization. For more information please see the resource guide for international students or contact Kathy Quispe directly. Endowment tax: Congress continues to discuss a future budget bill that may include an increase in the tax rate on the endowments of nonprofit colleges and universities. Currently, federal policy applies an endowment tax of 1.4% on the net investment income of universities with endowments greater than $500,000 per student, which includes Pomona. Since the inception of that policy in 2017, Pomona College has paid more than $16 million in such taxes, which is roughly equivalent to 184 full scholarships.\n\nWe are closely following the continuing budget discussions around the possibility of increasing this tax rate for select nonprofit colleges and universities. In essence, every 1% of endowment tax results in a $2 million reduction in spending on College needs from Pomona’s endowment’s annual returns. You can read more about our endowment, its importance to the College’s investments in our educational program and our students, and related matters on the new website we have created for this purpose.\n\nWe are partnering with other liberal arts colleges and our national educational associations to convey to federal legislators and their staffs our concerns about the risks to education, access to a college education, and affordability that would result from increasing the endowment tax on nonprofit institutions like Pomona.\n\nPell Grants: As you may know, Pell Grants constitute the largest source of post-secondary education grants in the country, annually helping more than 6.5 million undergraduate students with exceptional financial need realize their aspirations for a 4-year college education. Recent cuts to the U.S. Department of Education, which manages the Pell Grant program, have raised concerns that this program could face cuts as well. I want to share with you that the Pell Grant program has historically enjoyed strong bipartisan support, and we are hopeful that Congressional budget discussions will not result in reductions to Pell funding.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office recently announced its calculations that by the time the federal fiscal year ends on September 30, 2025, the Pell Grant program likely will face a $2.7 billion shortfall. Congress continues to discuss how it will address that shortfall, but whatever decisions Congress may make on that matter will not affect the current academic year. The College stands by all financial commitments to continuing and incoming students.\n\nWhile Pomona’s generous financial aid program meets an extensive portion of student financial aid needs, the College will continue to convey to leadership on Capitol Hill our strong view of the vital importance of the Pell Grant program to educational opportunity and access.\n\nI realize that the uncertainty around these and other matters can be very disconcerting, and we will continue to provide regular updates and do our best to keep you informed. These FAQs provide information about the Congressional inquiry as well as other federal matters. Please let us know of any questions at campusquestions@pomona.edu or reach out to the following offices as noted:\n\nFor student-related questions and support resources: Dean of Students Avis Hinkson or her staff members who serve as class deans.\n\nInternational students, please reach out to Kathy Quispe, assistant director of international student & scholar services.\n\nFor questions related to faculty: Dean of the College Melanie Wu\n\nFor staff and employee support: Assistant Vice President of Human Resources Alejandra Gaytan\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines\n\nActing President\n\nEdwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "Dear Pomona College community,\n\nI have been made aware of a flyer being distributed on campus that suggests the College will expose student identities in its response to the recent Congressional inquiry we received. This flyer misrepresents matters grossly, and I am concerned about the unfounded worries it could create about matters of critical importance to all of us.\n\nAs I conveyed in my email yesterday afternoon, the College is strictly committed to its legal obligation to protect the privacy of our students, in accordance with laws that include the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Having consistently sought to follow the spirit and letter of this legal requirement, we certainly intend to do so as we resolve with representatives of the Congressional committee the extent of their inquiry. This means, contrary to the misinformation on the flyer and in some media reports, that the College will not expose student identities unless obligations to the law stipulate otherwise—and that is not the case at this time. The College cannot act lawlessly, but the College will take every appropriate step to protect student identities.\n\nI do not know who is distributing this flyer, but I am sorry it is propagating misinformation.\n\nPlease let us know at campusquestions@pomona.edu if you have questions about these or other matters related to federal policy and debates, and we will do our best to answer them as part of future campus updates or through related FAQs. I will share my latest campus update on federal policy matters with you this week.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBob\n\nRobert R.

    "content": "Dear Pomona College Community,\n\nI write to share with you that this past Thursday afternoon, the College received a letter jointly signed by the chairs of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce and its Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development. Because the committee has made the letter public, I am able to share the letter for your reference. As you will see, the letter communicates that the committee seeks extensive information related to protests on our campus since October 7, 2023. I very much appreciate that this request raises many questions and concerns for all of us in the Pomona community. I also trust that you would value knowing the facts.\n\nSince receiving this letter, we have been working with legal counsel and other advisors to fully understand every aspect of the committee’s request. We intend to ensure that we uphold Pomona’s mission and values as we meet our legal obligations. I want to be transparent with you and share what we know at this time:\n\nWe are in the process of evaluating the committee’s requests and will discuss the scope of its inquiry with committee staff. The College has not yet shared any information with the committee.\n\nIn responding to this letter, the College has two instructive legal obligations: Committees of the House of Representatives have the right under federal law to request and receive information. Following our discussions with the committee’s representatives about the scope of its inquiry, we will meet the requirement of responding in good faith to the committee’s request for information. The College also has the important legal obligation, in accordance with laws that include the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to protect the privacy of our students. We take this responsibility seriously and have consistently sought to follow the spirit and letter of this legal requirement.\n\n\n\nIn responding to the committee’s request, I want to assure you that we will uphold Pomona’s unwavering commitment to protecting the release of personally identifiable student information consistent with the relevant privacy laws. You can learn more about FERPA and our student records privacy policy on our website.\n\nIn light of the attention news and social media can bring to these matters, I do feel obligated to note as well that the College cannot control how such outlets reveal information.\n\nI also want to stress that the College is firmly committed to ensuring a welcoming environment for all and to supporting the right of all of our students, including our Jewish students, to a Pomona education, including taking every appropriate step to prevent antisemitism. As you know, the College continues to engage in meaningful conversations with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Brandeis Center on additional actions the College can take to live up to these goals, fight antisemitism, and fully support the learning and campus experience of our Jewish students.\n\nAs the outline above may still leave you with questions, I invite you to submit them to campusquestions@Pomona.edu. To every extent possible, we will do our best in the days and weeks ahead to address the questions we can, whether as part of campus updates or through related FAQs. In the meantime, I will continue to share the regular campus updates I have been providing on matters of federal policy that affect the College, including my next update this coming Wednesday, when I will address the latest developments on such issues as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the endowment tax.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBob\n\nRobert R.

    "content": "Dear Pomona College Community:\n\nAs I write with my latest update on developments in Washington related to higher education, I do so with hopes that you are doing okay in the aftermath of last night’s scary developments. We are of course pleased that it turned out to be a false alarm and that everyone is safe. But events like this tax our coping mechanisms, and I encourage everyone to consider whether they want to take advantage of the many support and counseling services available on campus for students and faculty and staff. I am grateful for the way everyone on campus looked out for each other throughout this situation, and I hope that we can all find time to rest and restore ourselves during spring break.\n\nIt was wonderful to be in community at the Staff Forum this week and to experience again personally the vital engagement of our staff in everything the College does for our mission of educating our talented students from all backgrounds. My special thanks to the members of Staff Council for their leadership on campus and execution of this well-attended staff gathering.\n\nIndeed, allow me to take a moment to thank faculty, staff and students for your graciousness in welcoming me into this acting presidency role and making the experience so meaningful. Amid all the challenges we face, working with you in this position reminds me every day why I am optimistic about Pomona and its future.\n\nAs you know, the issues under discussion about higher education seem to change daily. We continue to be vigilant about these developments and how they could impact our campus. First I want to speak to questions raised by recent nationwide discussions by making clear that the College strongly upholds every student’s right to peaceful protest, as established in the Claremont Colleges Demonstration Policy. Allow me also to provide an update on several other matters of current national discussion.\n\nClaims of Antisemitism\n\nAs you may have seen, last week, the College received an “F” grade in the campus antisemitism report card released annually by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). This is of course disappointing, and something we take quite seriously. Subsequently, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) included Pomona in its list of 60 higher education institutions with pending antisemitism OCR investigations that were warned of potential enforcement actions if they did not comply with Title VI to protect Jewish students on campus.\n\nLet me be categorically clear: The College is firmly committed to assuring the right of our Jewish students—and of all our students—to access the full benefits of a Pomona education, including taking every appropriate step to prevent antisemitism and all forms of shared ancestry discrimination and harassment. Furthermore, we will continue to work on concrete steps to live up to this value, including taking additional actions to support our Jewish students and ensure their uninterrupted access to higher education on our campus.\n\nExecutive Orders and Related Impacts\n\nImmigration : This past weekend, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out one of its first reported enforcement actions on a U.S. college campus, at Columbia University. This matter leads me to remind you of the information and FAQs provided to you via email last month about steps to take if such enforcement actions occur at Pomona. (To access this material, log in to the my.pomona.eduportal.) As we head into spring break, I also encourage international students to review this resource guide for international students as they travel.\n\n: This past weekend, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out one of its first reported enforcement actions on a U.S. college campus, at Columbia University.

Federal Funding for Research: The litigation challenging the executive orders attempting to freeze research federal funds continues to hold those orders at abeyance, and there have been positive signs in those court cases, which we continue to monitor closely.\n\nCommunity Care and Resources\n\nI recognize that the many uncertainties these government matters create can be distressing.

I look forward to seeing you back on campus afterward and to enjoying the second half of this semester with you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines\n\nActing President and Edwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "Dear Pomona College community,\n\nI write to update you on the latest developments from Washington, D.C. that are impacting our College community. In doing so, I first want to reaffirm without equivocation Pomona’s enduring mission of providing quality education to talented students. Last week, I met with other college leaders involved with the American Talent Initiative which aims to increase access to higher education for low-income students. Pomona is a founding member institution of this initiative and our commitment to college access remains as strong as ever. We believe our nation and our economy benefit from cultivating and supporting students from all income levels in their quest to pursue higher education.\n\nIn addition, the College remains firmly committed to academic freedom, and the cultivation of an environment free from bias, stigma, or harassment through the fostering of an inclusive and diverse environment that supports inter-cultural connection, compassion, and opportunity. These values form the foundation of Pomona and its service to our students, the advancement of knowledge and understanding and social progress for the good of all. Due to significant interest in the broader College community about how these recent developments are impacting the College, I will summarize here for you the latest legal developments surrounding decisions in our nation’s capital and how they affect the College.\n\nExecutive Orders Overview\n\nAs you know, in the first weeks of his second term, President Trump announced a number of Executive Orders that threatened to seriously impact higher education institutions, faculty and students, including at Pomona. Subsequently, multiple states, non-profit associations (including higher education associations of which Pomona is a member) and other affected institutions have filed lawsuits challenging the legality of many of these orders. In numerous instances, federal judges considering these lawsuits have ruled that various provisions within the Executive Orders are likely unconstitutional and have preliminarily enjoined certain federal officials from implementing such orders. It is anticipated that the Trump administration will challenge these rulings; for now, however, some elements of the relevant Executive Orders remain enjoined from proceeding forward. That includes the Executive Order that would have cut previously awarded competitive grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), of which, I am proud to say, several of our faculty are recipients.\n\n“Dear Colleague” Letter\n\nMeanwhile, on February 14, the Department of Education (DOE) issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to all institutions of higher education related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Based on its interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision (Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard [SFFA])—which made the use of race in college admissions illegal—the department advised that no educational institution may use race or “non-racial information as a proxy for race” in decisions of any kind. The DOE also advised that it intended to begin investigating institutions for compliance within 14 days of its letter (February 28, 2025) and that institutions found in violation of its determination risked losing federal funding. As the letter has generated significant concern in the higher education community, I want to confirm that the College complies with relevant state and federal law and does not consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in its practices. At the same time, while the College is working to evaluate the potential implications of the letter, its mission and values have not changed.\n\nThe DOE’s letter has been met with a lawsuit, and so a judge will determine its legality. In the meantime, the College will continue to work with its partners to monitor related developments.\n\nIf you have any interest in seeing the entirety of Executive Orders that have been issued with an impact on higher education, you can find that information on this compilation site provided by the American Council of Education (ACE), a national association of higher education institutions to which Pomona belongs and which was a party to the lawsuit challenging the NIH cuts. Please note many of the orders cited by ACE have been enjoined by federal courts.\n\nCollege’s Resources and Conversations\n\nPlease know that Pomona is committed to supporting all members of our community. I also refer you to the previous information we have shared about these matters and the related frequently asked questions regarding immigration protocols (Login to Pomona’s portal is required to access the FAQ.) Executive staff members and I have attended several in-person meetings with faculty, staff and students to provide updates and to answer questions on the College’s approach to these executive orders. We will continue to do our best to keep you informed as these issues unfold and as Pomona does its best to respond accordingly.\n\nIn the meantime, we continue to convey Pomona’s deep concern about these issues to our federal legislators and their staffs and to encourage friends of the College across the country to do so as well. We also continue to work with and learn from the excellent work that national higher education bodies are doing to represent the best interests of colleges and universities as these national debates unfold. I am grateful to all those sharing their views as citizens with our legislators and to everyone across the College community supporting one another in many ways as we together advance the College’s vital commitment to education, understanding and community.\n\nWith appreciation,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines, acting president and Edwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "Dear Sagehen Community,\n\n​​​​​I am pleased to share the following update on how Pomona students, faculty, staff, and alumni are making an impact on campus and beyond.\n\nClass of 2024\n\nEach year​,​ we eagerly anticipate the First Destination Report​,​ researched and produced by the Career Development Office (CDO)​,​ ​which shows​ where our most recent alumni land after graduation. This year, 62% of our 2024 graduates chose to enter the workforce, applying their Pomona education ​at​ organizations ranging from Teach for America to American Express, the Associated Press to Microsoft and Netflix. The top five industries for the Class of 2024 are internet and software/technology, financial services/investment banking/management, higher education, management consulting​​ and healthcare.\n\nAnother 27% of our new​est​ alumni have enrolled in graduate programs. Members of the Class of 2024 ​are attending​ Harvard, the London School of Economics, Yale, New York University, Georgetown, Cambridge, UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, and many other distinguished institutions.\n\nMore than 30 graduates received fellowships as a result of their academic achievements, hard work, and the support of faculty and members of the CDO team. We continue to be a leading producer of Fulbrights, with 13 Fulbright Scholars last year. Congratulations to each recipient and to the members of the Sagehen community who supported them throughout their undergraduate careers​.​\n\nReaccreditation Process\n\nEvery 10 years, Pomona participates in the reaccreditation process with the ​​Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), an important step in affirming the rigor and quality of our academic program. As part of the College’s current ​​WASC accreditation cycle, we are participating in a remote special visit with an external review team in mid-April. Many thanks to the College’s working group which has been preparing for this visit since last summer. One of the group’s tasks was to produce a report responding to questions raised by the WASC Senior College and Universities Commission review team as part of our last reaccreditation process which concluded successfully in 2021. The group’s report is now available to the campus community (must login to the College’s portal to view the report.) After completion of the special visit in April, the College will receive feedback from WASC in early July 2025.\n\nAdvisory Committee on Social Responsibility\n\n​​I’m also thrilled to report that ​​w​ork on re-establishing the President’s Advisory Committee on Social Responsibility (CSR) is well underway. This group includes representation from students, faculty, staff and alumni: Senior Director of the Pomona Plan Art Landerholm ’92, Director of Sustainability and Energy Management Alexis Reyes, Director of Smith Campus Center and Staff Council Member Erica Tyron, APSC President Devlin Orlin ’25, Selene Li ’26, Professor of Classics Ken Wolf, Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy Kaley McCluskey and Assistant Professor of Politics Sara Sadhwani. The following staff will serve as ex-officio members of the committee: Vice President, COO & Treasurer Jeff Roth, Chief Investment Officer Dave Wallace, Chief of Staff Christina Ciambriello and Secretary to the Board Geoff Pearson. My thanks to all the members and especially to Erica and Ken​,​ who have agreed to co-chair this exceptional group. ​We look​forward to hearing more about this committee’s work in the coming months.\n\nAcademic Activities\n\nI’m proud that Pomona will host the Claremont Center for the Mathematical Sciences Colloquium’s screening and reception for “Journeys of Black Mathematicians,” part II, on Feb. 19. The documentary, six years in the making, includes appearances by Edray Goins, professor of mathematics and statistics at Pomona. He also advised on the project, which tells the compelling stories ​of ​Black mathematicians who have impacted the field and whose achievements continue to inspire students today. I regret that I’ll have to miss this event, but I’m learning that the life of a College President involves a lot of work off-campus.\n\nSeveral of our faculty have been sharing their expertise in the media, addressing some of the major challenges facing our region and country today. Professor of History and Environmental Analysis Char Miller has been especially generous with his knowledge and time, sharing analysis of the recent Southern California wildfires with news media around the world, from California to France, Germany and even Australia.\n\nFour students are studying abroad this semester with the support of the U.S. Department of State’s Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship Program. These scholarships help make international study more accessible for students with limited financial means. Nicole Desjardins Gowdy, senior director of our International and Domestic Programs Office, notes that Pomona students’ success rate for attaining the scholarship is twice the national average. This reflects one of our strategic vision pillars of equity and access as well as Pomona’s increasing global imprint.\n\nOur alumni ​also ​continue to make us proud. Mac Barnett ’04, a former English major, has already published more than 60 children’s books in the two decades since he graduated from Pomona. His books have sold over 5 million copies, been translated into more than 30 languages, and won two Caldecott Honors. Now he has been named national ambassador for Young People’s Literature by the Library of Congress. Congratulations to Mac.\n\nFinally, I invite you to check out a short video with clips of current Pomona students sharing what they are looking forward to this semester. Our students are the inspiration for everything we do. Thank you for helping them fulfill their ​​dreams.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines, acting president and Edwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "Dear Pomona College community,\n\nIn uncertain times, I have often found grounding in being a part of the Pomona College family. I reach out today to provide an update on the College’s planning and monitoring regarding current Executive Orders and proposed federal policies. We continue to track these matters closely, to discuss them with legal and governmental counsel, and to discuss their implications among the executive staff, with faculty leadership, and with other campus constituencies.\n\nAs we continue to diligently monitor these ongoing developments in a rapidly changing landscape for higher education, we will be communicating with you frequently on the latest updates that may have bearing on the College and on members of our community. As we determine how best to proceed, our priority will continue to be the safety and wellbeing of everyone in our campus community. Of course, we also will comply with all laws.\n\nFor anyone experiencing great strain or stress from the various Executive Orders, please remember that support is available in many places across this caring community, where we prize intellectual and personal diversity. We also encourage faculty and staff to reach out to Human Resources and students to contact their class deans with individual concerns they may have. Most importantly, we know everyone will keep looking out for each other. As we determine how best to proceed, our priority will continue to be the safety and wellbeing of everyone in our campus community.\n\nAt this time, allow me to share with you the array of College actions we are pursuing around the Executive Orders and proposed federal policies that have been initiated so far:\n\nImmigration policies : We have developed a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to provide guidance for our campus community in the event that immigration officers come to our campus. Login to Pomona’s portal is required to access the FAQ.\n\n: We have developed a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to provide guidance for our campus community in the event that immigration officers come to our campus. Login to Pomona’s portal is required to access the FAQ. Federal funding : As you may know, the recent Executive Order that initially called for a freeze of certain aspects of federal funding would have adversely affected work at the College. That fact led us to develop related plans and guidance that we will share with those affected should that freeze or any portions of it be reinitiated. Meanwhile, we’ve reached out to our current students and to admitted students entering the College this fall to assure them that this federal funding issue does not affect our financial aid commitment to them. We also will be communicating with our elected representatives about the problems and risks such a federal funding freeze would create.\n\n: As you may know, the recent Executive Order that initially called for a freeze of certain aspects of federal funding would have adversely affected work at the College.

Our practices are and will remain consistent with the law. We stand ready to support all members of our community. Potential endowment tax: We are doing a scrupulous risk analysis of the impact such a tax could have on the College and its services. As you can imagine, at any level such a tax would impede the resources our endowment makes possible for almost every aspect of College life, and we are working with our legislative liaisons and with other institutions to share these concerns with leaders on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn these and other matters under discussion in Washington, DC, we are in close touch with national and state government relations associations that provide counsel and the latest updates from D.C. and Sacramento. Our longstanding commitment to advocate for higher education and liberal arts education is unwavering. We continue to work with peer institutions to advocate in Washington on behalf of liberal arts colleges.\n\nDuring my recent meetings with college leaders from around the country, we readily agreed that what we love most is the enduring mission we share to educate students of exceptional promise. Now more than ever, let’s center our work on the shared mission of our Pomona community and the joy it brings to each one of us.\n\nThis College’s values remain strong. Our campus community is resilient. I believe wholeheartedly that Pomona’s close engagement across a diverse group of faculty, staff, alumni and classmates strengthens our students’ learning as they engage in the probing inquiry and creative exploration that will make them our next generations of leaders.\n\nRobert Gaines, acting president and Edwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "In a recent Brown and White editorial, \"Unsigned, Lehigh's silence speaks volumes,\" the Brown and White editorial board raised important questions related to Lehigh's response to actions impacting higher education, including the recent American Association of Colleges and Universities statement. Below is President Helble's response which was shared with the Brown and White on April 28, 2025.\n\nIn your recent editorial, “Unsigned, Lehigh’s silence speaks volumes,” you raised important questions regarding increased – and in my view unprecedented – government intervention in higher education, and its impact on academic freedom and the pursuit of truth. You also asked very directly why Lehigh had not signed the recent AAC&U statement calling for constructive engagement in response to government overreach.\n\nDo not conflate a lack of signature on a public petition with a lack of engagement on this critically important issue.\n\nI firmly believe that this is a moment where active engagement is essential. Over the past few months, I have had many substantive discussions with U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie and other elected officials to advocate for support of research, to call for an end to the abrupt termination of the visa status of hundreds of international graduate students across the country including a few at Lehigh, and to seek ways to move toward collaborative partnership between the government and higher education to combat antisemitism. I joined the presidents of other local colleges and universities to meet with Rep. Mackenzie and with the offices of our U.S. senators to speak directly about the potential harm to Lehigh Valley institutions and students from the large volume of vague executive orders. Members of Lehigh’s leadership team and I recently hosted several local state-elected officials, as well as representatives from the offices of county, state and federal officials on campus, where we discussed the value of our growing research activity and its positive impact on the region and the state. We continually and proactively engage with those who can directly influence decisions that impact our academic mission, the experiences of our students, faculty, and staff, and advocate on behalf of Lehigh’s entire campus community.\n\nI respect the right of many of my presidential colleagues to add their names to the AAC&U statement, and I agree with the general points made in that brief document. But I have not signed open public letters, here or in the past, as I do not see them as an effective way to support Lehigh’s students, faculty, staff, mission, and values. That is especially true when signing a public statement somehow becomes seen as a litmus test for one’s values.\n\nI trust that every member of our community values independence of thought and would not argue that one should sign a document simply because others have. I firmly believe the way to assert Lehigh’s values, support Lehigh’s students and community and further Lehigh’s mission is to engage in substantive conversations focused on the potential harms to Lehigh specifically and higher education more generally from ongoing and proposed federal action.\n\nLehigh remains actively engaged with higher education community partners and professional associations, including the American Council on Education (ACE), National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU) and NAFSA: Association of International Educators. These organizations offer collective insight, thought partnership and advocacy.\n\nLehigh remains steadfast in offering support, solidarity, and commitment to our international community. Our Office of International Students and Scholars continues to closely monitor developments in immigration policy and processes and is communicating regularly with international students, faculty, and staff ensuring those impacted are aware of all available resources and understand their rights, as well as their options for continuing their academic programs. Our international community is vital to making us who we are, and it is not just our students – roughly 1/3 of our faculty members have earned at least one of their degrees from an institution outside the United States. As I said recently and publicly, a global community of scholars and students of the type we have at Lehigh, engaged in open debate and discussion of ideas, is the very definition of an American university, and is why this country continues to attract talent from across the world. Anyone who walked through our 36th Annual International Bazaar this weekend would have seen students generously sharing their cultures and learning and could not help but recognize the good their presence brings to all.\n\nLehigh University remains dedicated to advancing learning through teaching, research, and service to others. We are committed to advocating for policies that uphold the independence of higher education and to supporting every member of our campus community. We will continue to champion the values that define our institution and ensure that our voices are heard in the ongoing dialogue about the future of American higher education.\n\nThat may not, and likely will not, mean signing general public petitions. But joining with peers to provide substantive input on policy and criticism of actions, and speaking directly with a data-informed and strong voice to advocate for our values and mission is what I will, and what we must, continue to do if we are to ensure the strength and independence of this extraordinary system of higher education that has served this country singularly well and has been a beacon for the talented from around the globe for nearly a century.",

    "content": "Lehigh University’s Spring Strategy Town Hall, held on April 17, spotlighted momentum in its transformative 10-year strategy, Inspiring the Future Makers . With progress across research, education, campus engagement and innovation, university leaders shared milestones and highlighted progress on ambitious new initiatives aimed at reshaping Lehigh for the next decade and beyond.\n\nPresident Joseph J. Helble ’82 opened the town hall by reaffirming the university’s commitment to long-term, measurable impact through the Future Makers strategy. “Our strategy is a roadmap for decision-making to guide our efforts and investments for up to a decade to come,” said Helble. “We’re excited to reflect on the progress we've made and the impactful strides ahead.”\n\nFrom establishing two new University Research Centers this year to launching a forward-looking approach to undergraduate education, the meeting highlighted progress and purposeful ambition.\n\nKey Highlights and New Initiatives\n\nExpanding Research Impact\n\nIn February, Lehigh announced the launch of two new University Research Centers (URCs ),furthering its commitment to solving real-world challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration:\n\nThe Center for Community-Driven Assistive Technologies (CDAT)\n\nThe Center for Advancing Community Electrification Solutions (ACES)\n\nThese additions follow the establishment of Lehigh’s first URC, the Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience , which launched in February 2024. Together, the three centers form the foundation of a growing research ecosystem aimed at addressing urgent societal issues—from supporting individuals with disabilities to helping communities transition to increased demand for electrical power from areas like transportation, building systems and data centers. .\n\n“These centers are designed to drive real-world impact,” said Provost Nathan Urban. “We are uniting faculty across colleges to confront pressing issues—from community electrification to inclusive assistive technology solutions.”\n\nUrban also celebrated Lehigh’s new designation as an R1 research university by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, placing it among the top 187 research universities in the U.S., a pivotal moment in the school’s research trajectory.\n\nReimagining the First-Year Experience\n\nWith a three-year pilot launching in Fall 2025, Lehigh’s new Exploratory First Semester Program will support first-semester, undecided students through a unique, problem-solving curriculum designed to enhance advising and career discovery.\n\n“This program will allow students to explore their interests without stigma and find academic paths that truly excite them,” explained Terry-Ann Jones, deputy provost for undergraduate education. “We want every student to feel confident and supported as they explore their academic path—replacing uncertainty with a strong sense of belonging, possibility and purpose.”\n\nInnovation in Education for Student Success: Math and AI\n\nLehigh is tackling academic barriers head-on with a belonging-focused intervention in calculus courses. With early data showing reduced failure rates and improved grades, the approach is showing promise. Looking ahead to Fall 2025, plans are to bring a generative AI tutor/coach to support student learning.\n\n“Grades in gateway courses like calculus can define a student’s path,” said Urban. “We can help students learn more through interventions that are rooted in research and designed to foster both success and confidence.”\n\nUrban also described a pilot of “Calculus for Makers,” a Spring 2025 initiative combining learning of calculus theory and applications with hands-on design in collaboration with Lehigh’s Design Labs.\n\nEmpowering the Community Through Engagement\n\nInterim Vice President for Strategic Planning Mark Erickson outlined the university’s efforts to engage the campus deeply and consistently. “This is a living strategy,” Erickson noted. “We’re raising funds, building branding and launching a campus master plan all informed by the strategy and community input.”\n\n2024/2025 Engagement Initiatives include:\n\nTown halls each semester\n\nSix small discussion dinners at the President’s residence\n\nFive Future Maker Forums\n\nAI Summit and Advisory Committee\n\nContinued investment in Future Maker Grants —fueling innovation from the ground up\n\n“The Future Maker Grants have ignited creativity and collaboration in ways that truly align with our vision,” said Erickson.\n\nBuilding the Organization of the Future\n\nThe university is also undergoing changes to improve responsiveness, resource planning and campus operations. New technologies like the RAPTOR resource planning system, unified communication platforms and mobile credentials are being rolled out, along with efforts to streamline website and AV support.\n\n“These upgrades are not just about tools,” Erickson said. “They are about reimagining how we operate as a modern university.”\n\nAI as a Strategic Priority\n\nAI is no longer a niche interest at Lehigh—it’s becoming a centerpiece of its academic and operational evolution. The Generative AI Advisory Committee , announced during the January AI Summit, has begun making recommendations for university-wide adoption of AI in teaching, research and administration.\n\n“This is a transformational moment,” Urban emphasized. “Generative AI is reshaping education and the workforce. Lehigh must lead,not follow,in this space.”\n\nA Collective Path Forward\n\nThe university is preparing to release a Community and Economic Impact Report at its May board meeting. From bold educational reform to innovative research expansion, the Lehigh Strategy continues to set the stage for a future where creativity, community and progress intersect.\n\nFor More Information\n\nStory by Amy Bilello",

    "content": "While the advancements in quantum computing and artificial intelligence have their share of risks, they also allow us to make findings, correlations and discoveries that were once thought to be out of reach, he said.\n\n“We will be able to soon land on Mars, we will discover new cures for endemic diseases and we will continue to lift tens of millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class,” Verma said.\n\nHe said that Americans continue to do so much good in the world, from the work of the U.S. State Department, military and Peace Corps volunteers to workers aiding in charitable organizations. He also stressed that American engagement and leadership in the world matters more than ever before, and that foreign policy begins at home.\n\nHe told the audience that they have a greater role to play in the execution of U.S. foreign policy than they might even imagine, simply by traveling, trading, studying and visiting in a foreign country.\n\n“The people-to-people contacts that you make, the friendships and relationships you build, the values you share… this will be the glue that holds us together,” Verma said. “This is the connective tissue that withstands political disruption and the noise of social media. You actually are practicing foreign policy whether you realize it or not, and I would simply say, ‘Thank you, and keep it up.’”\n\nVerma recalled a time when he met with President Obama in the Oval Office ahead of a visit to India as the country’s U.S. ambassador.\n\n“[President Obama] reminded me that when you consider the course of human history, we are in these jobs but for the blink of an eye, and that we just have to stay true to our values and make the place a little better for those who come after you,” Verma said.\n\nHe encouraged the audience to keep working for the betterment of future generations, even though progress may seem slow and uncertain.\n\n“Thank you, Lehigh and the Lehigh Valley. You do have a lot of heart and outstanding character, and I know we all will keep laboring until the work is done to make things just a bit better for all those who come after us,” Verma said.\n\nFollowing Verma’s remarks, Helble engaged in a conversation with Verma before opening it up to questions from the audience. Helble asked about Verma’s experience as U.S. ambassador to India, as well as the current state of relations between the U.S. and India.\n\nVerma reflected on words that President Obama and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi had shared with him—that “the real measure of success in the relationship was not what we would do for each other, but what we were doing for others in the world.”\n\nVerma explained that the U.S. and India working together to bring agriculture, health solutions, science, innovation and discoveries to other parts of the world sends a powerful message and measure of success that he wanted people to remember. He said that while the U.S. has done exceptionally well in working on key pillars of cooperation, there’s still progress to be made, and he feels optimistic about the future.",

    "content": "During his latest Community Conversation, President Joseph J. Helble ’82 acknowledged that although there are headwinds facing higher education, Lehigh is experiencing a remarkable period of growth.\n\nHelble talked about the university’s exponential growth in research, faculty recognition, the launch of new deeply interdisciplinary academic programs, record-breaking admissions figures and philanthropy efforts, and recent achievements in athletics. He gave updates on the Inspiring the Future Makers Strategy and university facilities, as well as updates on federal actions in regard to higher education. Helble also touched on fostering discussions on campus that lead to productive exchange that can help the community learn and grow.\n\n“This is a time of tremendous growth for this university, intellectually. It is a time when our programs are having tremendous impact, and it is a time where we are getting increasing recognition externally for the work that our faculty, staff and students are doing,” he said, to an audience gathered in Forum 101 in the Health, Science and Technology Building and tuning in via Zoom. “It is a moment that, despite the headwinds facing higher education, I hope you will be extraordinarily proud of what’s happening here at Lehigh.”\n\nCommunity Conversations are designed for students, faculty and staff to learn important updates about the Lehigh community and ask questions. Below are some highlights from the latest Community Conversation.\n\nResearch\n\nHelble opened his presentation with an update on research. He said that the university is well on its way to doubling its research activity within a decade, including research funding, as part of the Future Makers Strategy. Lehigh’s sponsored program expenditure grew from $40 million in fiscal year 2021 to $58.7 million in fiscal year 2024—an increase of 47% over three years.\n\nAdditionally, Lehigh was designated as an R1 research university in February by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Attaining R1 status, the highest level of research activity in the Carnegie Classification system, is a milestone that means a university conducts a “very high volume of research” and awards a large number of research doctorates, according to the Carnegie Classification. Lehigh is the only university in the Lehigh Valley to have the designation and one of seven in the state.\n\nAs part of the Future Makers Strategy, Helble noted that the university made a commitment to establish three interdisciplinary research centers, or University Research Centers (URCs). In 2024, Lehigh launched the Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience , a URC through which researchers explore how hurricanes, pandemics and other large-scale events impact communities. In February, Lehigh launched two new URCs : the Center for Community-Driven Assistive Technologies (CDAT) and the Center for Advancing Community Electrification Solutions (ACES). CDAT will explore novel ways to improve the lives of people with disabilities, while ACES will focus on creating efficient, reliable and self-sustaining energy systems.\n\nFaculty Recognition\n\nHelble noted “tremendous positive news” concerning Lehigh faculty and their external recognition. Six faculty members were named senior members of the National Academy of Inventors in February, recognizing the growing amount of entrepreneurial activity happening on campus, he said. Included in the cohort is Volkmar Dierolf, professor of physics; Xiaoji Xu, associate professor of chemistry; Jonas Baltrusaitis, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering; Xuanhong Cheng, professor of bioengineering and materials science and engineering; Siddha Pimputkar, associate professor of materials science and engineering; and Yahong Rosa Zheng, professor of electrical and computer engineering.\n\nIn January, Hannah Dailey ’02 ’06G ’09 Ph.D., associate professor of mechanical engineering and mechanics, was named a 2024 recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PCASE) by the Biden administration. The award recognizes exceptional young professionals in science and engineering.\n\nProfessor Dan M. Frangopol, the inaugural Fazlur R. Khan Endowed Chair of Structural Engineering and Architecture, was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in February for his contributions to life-cycle civil engineering and leadership in its global development and adoption.\n\nAcademics\n\nLehigh launched “new, radically interdisciplinary inter-college programs,” including the Integrated Business and Health (IBH) program , Helble said. For the inaugural fall 2025 IBH cohort, 187 applications were received. Additionally, the university will launch Explore Lehigh this fall, which is an exploratory first-semester program that will give incoming students the opportunity to explore the full curriculum broadly before making a decision of which college to enter and major to pursue.\n\n“These programs are distinctive parts of Lehigh, and part of what differentiates us as an institution,” Helble said. “Interdisciplinarity is a term that’s often tossed around lightly and loosely. This is something that Lehigh has been deeply committed to since the start of the first inter-college program more than 20 years ago, and it is something that truly sets us apart.”\n\nAdmissions\n\nLehigh’s applicant pool for the class of 2029 was the second largest in the university’s history. This year, the university received applications from all 50 U.S. states and 139 countries. Helble noted that 54% of undergraduate students receive some form of financial aid with an average award of $50,000. Currently, Lehigh is 20% first-generation students. In terms of socioeconomic diversity, 18% of students overall are recipients of the federal Pell Grant, which helps undergraduates from low-income families pay for college, with 23% in the current first-year class.\n\nIn the area of graduate applications, Helble said the goal this year was to increase master’s and certificate program applications by 10%. To date, Helble said master’s applications are up 67% over last year, and Ph.D. applications are up 74% compared to a year ago. Deposits for entering students at the master’s level are up 160%, and Ph.D. commitments are up 27% respectively.\n\nAs part of the Future Makers Strategy, Lehigh made a commitment to being a national leader in student outcomes. Helble said first-year student retention data for this year indicated a retention rate of 98.5%, which is up more than one percentage point compared to a year ago.\n\nAthletics\n\nLehigh recently welcomed Jeremy L. Gibson as the new Murray H. Goodman Dean of Athletics in January. In less than two months since Gibson’s arrival, the wrestling team has won the EIWA team championship and the women’s basketball team won the Patriot League Championship. These accomplishments follow the men’s lacrosse and football teams winning Patriot League titles within the past year.\n\n“It is a tremendous testament to our coaches and, of course, our student-athletes and the success of our programs,” Helble said.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nGiving Day + March Mania, a two-day focused fundraiser, resulted in Lehigh exceeding its goals for dollars and donors resoundingly, Helble said. Total donors amassed more than 4,600—a 22% increase over last year. More than $3 million was raised to support education and athletics on campus—a 40% increase and also an all-time high.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Clayton University Center at Packer Hall reopened in January four months ahead of schedule and under budget. Helble said he’s been gathering feedback on food and spaces within the Clayton UC, and feedback will continue to be reviewed over the summer, but overall the reaction to the renovated building “has been very, very positive.”\n\nLehigh Strategy Events\n\nThere are two upcoming events specifically related to the Lehigh strategy: the Inspiring the Future Makers Town Hall will be held on April 17, and A Shared Bethlehem Experience Future Makers Forum will be held on April 23. Building on last year’s success, Data Day 2025 will be held on May 8 and will highlight data, tools, case studies and insights to inform the university’s decision making.\n\nHelble also said an Economic and Community Impact Report will be published later this semester showcasing Lehigh’s role in contributing to the economic vitality and community wellbeing of the Lehigh Valley.\n\nFederal Update\n\nTo help the university digest, prepare, plan and respond to federal actions and policy changes, Helble noted that a working policy group has been assembled by Provost Nathan Urban. The group is tracking, assessing, responding and helping identify areas where the university may need to think about changes in the way it engages with the federal government, or changes in the way it does business, Helble said. Some of the areas they are tracking right now include diversity, equity and inclusion, immigration, research funding, taxation and the potential closure of the Department of Education.\n\n“Our commitment to community remains unchanged,” Helble said. “Our core values have always been about belonging and about enabling everyone the opportunity to be and become the best versions of themselves. To be able to be and bring, as I so often say, their full selves to everything that they do and to be challenged only in the classroom for their academic work. To enable them to be who they are and to be supported, nurtured and helped to grow and learn for who they are … That commitment is unchanging.”\n\nHelble noted the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights’ recent letter that included Lehigh as one of 60 institutions the federal government is watching and asking to be particularly attentive to steps to combat antisemitism. He said Lehigh has reached voluntary resolution with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights and there is no new information or new investigation.\n\n“Our commitment to being a campus that supports every student and every member of our community, and our commitment to being a campus that does not tolerate antisemitism has not changed,” Helble said.\n\nIn the area of research funding, Helble said, “Members of the Pennsylvania delegation are listening to us and engaging substantively in this conversation and asking how we can work together for the betterment of the country in this area and for the support of research at universities like Lehigh.”",

    "content": "Watch the video message.\n\nTranscript:\n\nIt's been an unusually busy start to the spring semester, both at Lehigh, as we advance our Inspiring the Future Makers Strategy, and across higher education, stemming from recent federal actions and policy changes. These actions have the potential to affect key areas of higher education and our work, including research funding, student support, DEI policies, and our partnerships with our international scholars. A policy group is meeting regularly to monitor and assess the changes, and we will keep the campus updated, if and as changes in our practices are needed. Despite some of the challenges facing higher education, our focus remains clear: advancing Lehigh's educational and research mission, being nimble and innovative, and fostering a community of belonging that welcomes and supports every individual. Lehigh remains steadfast in fostering an environment where all voices are valued, and where diverse perspectives strengthen our community--a commitment embedded in the Principles of our Equitable Community and a reminder that open dialogue is more important than ever. Our successes continue to be noticed. Lehigh was just designated an R1 Research University by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, the only R1 in the Lehigh Valley, and placing us among the nation's 187 leading research universities. This designation strengthens our ability to attract top faculty, staff, and students who want to be part of a university solving global challenges. Consistent with the growth and research that led to R1 designation, growth occurring at a rate exceeding the ambitious goals laid out in our Future Makers Strategy, we recently launched two new university research centers, one for community-driven assistive technologies, and one for advancing community electrification solutions. These join our Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience that was established last year, all focusing on tackling immediate real-world challenges. We're also launching an Exploratory First Semester Program this fall, consistent with our goal of expanding opportunities for deeply interdisciplinary learning. This pilot program will allow students to enter Lehigh without selecting a specific academic college in advance, giving them an opportunity to explore the full breadth of the curriculum. This all follows the January reopening of the Clayton University Center, on budget and a full semester ahead of schedule, now a space filled with students exploring every aspect of this reimagined iconic core of our campus. These are just recent examples of our continued work implementing the Lehigh Strategy, and through all of this, our commitment remains the same: investing in what matters most, our students, our faculty, and our staff, and the continued advancement of Lehigh's Mission.",

    "content": "“ACES aims to deliver energy independence and efficiency to a range of communities through electrification,” Kishore said, “which relies on electricity to meet energy needs and is a growing force in our economy. It is predicted that electricity needs will grow significantly in the next several decades as we switch to power many of our energy-intensive processes through electricity and with increased demand from energy-intensive computing in data centers.”\n\nKishore noted that work originating from the ACES Center may be applied to understanding communities that are seeing the increased use of electric vehicles, increased dependence on electric pumps to run water distribution systems and higher electricity demands due to power requirements of smart manufacturing facilities and AI data centers.\n\nACES will combine technology solutions with community needs, helping to reduce energy costs and promote energy security and independence. Faculty affiliated with the center will conduct interdisciplinary research in engineering, economics, social science, policy and data science to assess how to optimize functions and community impact of electricity-sheds. With strong partnerships and workforce development initiatives, ACES will lead the way in making electrification scalable and accessible.\n\n“Electrification of different sectors should not be done in silos, particularly since electrification makes them more and more tightly coupled to the power grid and therefore to each other,” Kishore said. “Our ACES team will leverage Lehigh's expertise and experience to understand the coupling between these different types of electrical loads and how the grid can be improved to jointly handle them.”\n\nThe ACES team has been developing concrete examples and partnerships their team might develop addressing community-scale electrification.\n\n“[One example is] electrification of coastal communities which face challenging energy and water needs and very high costs,” said Banerjee. “Another example could be electrification of warehousing districts and fleet operators, which is a Lehigh Valley concern. We could also be looking at electrification of industrial parks and campuses through the concept of virtual power plants.”\n\nTo enhance their research, Banerjee said the ACES team will leverage the interdisciplinary ecosystem within Lehigh. Faculty researchers committed to ACES are experts in a range of engineering and social science fields. The graduate and undergraduate students involved in ACES projects will benefit from this interdisciplinary work and engage in research that aims to deliver community impact, Banerjee said.\n\nSmall Cities Lab Awarded Planning Grant\n\nIn addition to naming these two new University Research Centers, a planning grant was awarded to Lehigh’s Small Cities Lab, led by Wes Hiatt, assistant professor in the art, architecture and design department and Karen Beck Pooley, professor of practice in the political science department. The Small Cities Lab is focused on the distinctive challenges faced by smaller cities typically overlooked in urban research as they tackle pressing issues such as affordable housing, economic development, public health and public history. The first research center of its kind at Lehigh, the Small Cities Lab is designed as an action-oriented collaborative hub that directly engages with communities to co-create practical, scalable solutions tailored to the unique needs of small cities. Reflecting the complex nature of cities, the Lab merges interdisciplinary research and hands-on student involvement with participatory design with innovative local partnerships, creating the potential to be an agent of transformational change.\n\nThe Lab will build on the success it has already seen in its first year by merging the expertise of faculty in multiple disciplines within the College of Arts & Sciences, College of Business, College of Health and the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering & Applied Science.\n\n“The work performed in the Small Cities Lab is integral to overcoming challenges faced by less expansive and populous metropolitan areas,” said Urban. “This planning grant will help advance research and drive collaboration, and ultimately improve and enhance the vibrancy of small cities including those in the Lehigh Valley.”\n\nA Priority Within the Lehigh Strategy\n\nThe new university research centers and Small Cities Lab directly align with the priorities outlined in the Lehigh Strategy, Inspiring the Future Makers. One of the strategy’s initiatives is investing significantly in interdisciplinary research, acknowledging that critical problems require a holistic approach.\n\n“The goal of establishing these URCs is to identify areas where, through strategic investment and careful planning, Lehigh can lead research nationally and internationally,” said Urban. “We are already seeing great momentum from the URC in Catastrophe Modeling, which is leading to enhanced visibility and philanthropic support. I am hopeful that these new URCs will develop in similar ways.”\n\nDuring the planning phase of the Lehigh Strategy in 2022, community feedback indicated interdisciplinary research was emerging as an institutional priority, specifically in the areas of innovation for sustainable and resilient infrastructure, assessing and improving health by working outside of healthcare settings and understanding conflict and change.\n\nWhen the Lehigh Strategy debuted a year later, it included an initiative focusing on strengthening and investing in interdisciplinary research. With the launch of the Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience in 2024, Lehigh reaffirmed its commitment to this initiative. These two additional university research centers underscore the importance of and need for interdisciplinary research and collaboration at the university. The goal outlined in the Lehigh Strategy is to establish multiple centers of prominence over time.",

His ability to balance competitive success with holistic student development aligns with our Lehigh values.\n\nPrior to Merrimack, Jeremy served at Harvard University for 17 years in several roles including Senior Associate Director of Athletics, where he was instrumental to the fundraising efforts that generated over $100 million to support capital projects, operational enhancements and endowments. Jeremy also played a key role in elevating women's rugby to varsity status.\n\nJeremy is known for his extensive work in community engagement, diversity initiatives, and capital project development. His leadership in growing athletic programs and generating vital fundraising support will be instrumental in advancing Lehigh Athletics and continuing to build on its proud tradition.\n\nI want to extend my gratitude to Nathan Urban, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, for chairing the search committee, and to the committee members for their dedicated service: Khayla Atte, Head Coach, Women's and Men's Track and Field; Allen Biddinger, Associate Athletics Director for Facilities and Events; Hannah Dailey, Associate Professor, Mechanical Engineering, and NCAA faculty representative; and Carol Packard, Vice President, Development and Alumni Relations; as well as Lucy Bowen, Director of Administration, Provost Office, for providing administrative and logistical support to the committee. The firm Korn Ferry assisted with the search.\n\nI want to acknowledge the Goodman family, whose endowment of this position has provided enduring support for our athletics program. This commitment reflects the remarkable legacy of Murray H. Goodman, whose recent passing reminds us of his profound impact on Lehigh and our community. I would also like to recognize Joe Sterrett, who has served with distinction as dean for many years. His leadership and dedication have been pivotal to the success of our athletic programs and the strength of our athletics community.\n\nJeremy’s vision and leadership will continue to elevate Lehigh Athletics, enriching the student-athlete experience and further reinforcing our commitment to academic excellence and community involvement.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Jeremy and his family to Lehigh University. I look forward to the continued growth and success of our student-athletes and athletic programs under his leadership.\n\nJoseph J. Helble ’82\n\nPresident",

    "content": "A Community Update\n\nA Message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg Community\n\nMonday, March 17, 2025 11:01 AM\n\nDear Muhlenberg Community,\n\nAs we begin the second half of the spring semester, I want to thank you for your continued commitment — to our community and to our core values. Our campus is known for the care and radical hospitality it shows to everyone. These are fundamental Muhlenberg values that endure and guide us forward each and every day.\n\nI am writing to provide an update on several pertinent campus matters.\n\nList of 60: Last week 60 colleges and universities, including Muhlenberg, received a letter from the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights (OCR) regarding compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The letter shares the current administration’s perspective on Title VI and references institutions currently under Title VI investigation or monitoring. To our knowledge, Muhlenberg is not on the list of institutions with open investigations related to shared ancestry. In 2024 Muhlenberg entered a resolution agreement with OCR, addressing a previous complaint, and continues to execute the agreement in all regards.\n\nNew Partnership: Muhlenberg College and Erie County Community College (ECCC) have announced a new transfer agreement to our School of Continuing Studies accelerated degree programs. We now have nine agreements with community colleges aimed at increasing access to a Muhlenberg education.\n\nFacility Improvements: It has been exciting to watch our ongoing capital projects move forward. Despite some delays with permits, Seegers Union is on track for completion in spring 2026. We anticipate Bicentennial Park and the new north-campus softball field will be ready for competition in April. Through live video, you can watch the progress on both projects through the Bicentennial Park feed and the softball field feed. Please stay tuned for updates about dedications for both fields, slated for the fall.\n\nDifficult Dialogues: Muhlenberg is deeply committed to freedom of expression and inquiry. The academic curriculum and college life programs provide opportunities for students to hone the liberal arts skills necessary to engage in conversations across different perspectives. I encourage everyone to participate in the robust programming and lectures offered throughout the semester. I continue to be impressed with how our students come together to advance meaningful and constructive dialogue in the midst of disagreement. That leadership is especially important now as we see deep divisions in our communities and society. How we respond says a lot about us.\n\nLast year, I joined College Presidents for Civic Preparedness, “a coalition of over 100 campus leaders from diverse ideologies, backgrounds, and institutions … committed to preparing students for active civic engagement.” The organization has three commitments: educating for democracy; preparing our students for a vibrant, diverse, and contentious society; and protecting and defending free inquiry.\n\nIn the face of extraordinary events in our history, each of these is vitally important. They are reflected clearly in Muhlenberg’s mission and core values. We will not waver in our own dedication to these principles, each of them critical to educating the next generation of leaders and, in doing so, advancing the common good.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKathleen E. Harring, Ph.D\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Message to the Community: Dear Colleague Letter\n\nA Message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg Community\n\nFriday, February 28, 2025 11:00 AM\n\nDear Muhlenberg Community,\n\nOver the past two weeks there has been much conversation about the “Dear Colleague” letter issued on February 14 by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Historically, “Dear Colleague” letters have been used to convey an administration’s interpretation of existing law.\n\nThe most recent “Dear Colleague” letter outlines the current administration’s framing of the Supreme Court ruling in the 2023 case of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (SSFA) that banned the use of race in admissions. It describes how it plans to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin by institutions of higher education that receive federal funding. The OCR letter takes a broader interpretation of the SSFA ruling, holding that institutions of higher education should also be prohibited from considering race in \"hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic and campus life.”\n\nMuhlenberg’s practices have always been in compliance with federal and state regulations. To date, there have not been any changes to established federal or state laws. In consultation with higher education professional organizations, leaders of peer institutions, and college counsel, we continue to seek clarity about any action that could result from this letter. Meanwhile, over the past two weeks the Equity and Inclusion Leadership Team has carefully reviewed Muhlenberg’s policies and practices to consider potential impacts. It is incumbent upon us to follow a process of due diligence. Again, while there have been no changes to established law, as a community we will continue to consider how to clearly describe programs and services and how they advance our mission and values.\n\nIn times of uncertainty and disruption we are guided by our mission and values—our north star. Muhlenberg’s mission is to develop graduates who are ready to lead and serve in a diverse global society. Our students are “independent critical thinkers who are intellectually agile, characterized by a zest for reasoned and civil debate, committed to understanding the diversity of the human experience, able to express ideas with clarity and grace, committed to lifelong learning, and equipped with ethical and civic values.” We are strongly committed to fostering a learning environment that aligns with our mission to provide an intellectually rigorous education within the context of an inclusive and diverse campus. Each facet of the Muhlenberg experience—the curriculum, college life programs, student services—is shaped by and advances our institutional mission.\n\nOur red doors are a reminder of our institutional values of respect and openness to the unique identities and experiences of all members of our community. That radical hospitality which is central to our identity, both past and present, means that each individual is welcomed, supported, recognized and valued in our community. It means we understand that our community members have different needs and that addressing those needs is essential to human flourishing and success.\n\nInclusive excellence is a responsibility each of us shares. Thank you for all you do to make this a reality.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nKathleen E. Harring, Ph.D\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Yale Faculty and Staff,\n\nRecent actions taken by the federal government have generated many questions about impacts to our work and community. In keeping with our commitment to sharing significant updates, we write to provide information on Yale’s current financial outlook and to ask for your help as we navigate a rapidly evolving landscape for all of higher education.\n\nAs we last reported to you in December 2024, Yale began the year in a good financial situation. However, recent federal actions that affectU.S. institutions of higher education suggest that the university—along with peers across the country—may face serious financial challenges in the coming months. If enacted, measures such as an increased tax on university endowments or cuts to federal research funds would have a profoundly negative impact on Yale’s finances and resources. Given these possible outcomes, it is important that we move forward with a shared understanding of plans to advance Yale’s mission.\n\nWe do not yet know whether or when many of the possible federal actions will take effect, nor do we know the scale of their impact. Considering these uncertainties, our approach to managing the university’s finances will be thoughtful and measured.\n\nLater this month, the university will begin the annual budget process , which will lead to the creation of Yale’s budget for the 2026 fiscal year. As a part of this process, we, together with the faculty and staff members of the Budget Advisory Group , will carefully review budget proposals from the university’s schools and units. This year, we have asked the leaders of all schools and units to prepare their budgets for the next fiscal year, assuming a standard set of budget parameters. However, we have also asked these leaders to engage in contingency planning by describing actions that might be necessary if federal policies were enacted that significantly reduce university revenue. This approach allows us to proceed in the face of uncertainty. We will advance Yale’s mission based on current law while preparing to pivot in the event that circumstances change.\n\nGiven the gravity of the current situation, we have decided there is a need to move more cautiously in the following ways:\n\n\n\nCapital Projects: We are reviewing the university’s capital projects to consider where delays to planned renovations and new construction may be warranted until we have greater clarity on the financial implications of federal actions.\n\nWe are reviewing the university’s capital projects to consider where delays to planned renovations and new construction may be warranted until we have greater clarity on the financial implications of federal actions. Salary Increases: We anticipate salary increases in the upcoming cycle for faculty and managerial and professional staff to be more modest than in previous years.\n\nBecause a reduction in university revenue will affect all areas of campus, we are looking for schools and units to assist with the following:\n\n\n\nSpending Restraint: We ask deans and other university leaders to carefully review significant multi-year commitments and slow non-salary expenditures where possible.\n\nWe ask deans and other university leaders to carefully review significant multi-year commitments and slow non-salary expenditures where possible. Hiring Restraint: We also ask these colleagues to review ongoing and planned faculty and staff searches to ensure that these roles are necessary for executing essential activities given the current environment.\n\nBe assured that university leaders and trustees are advocating for higher education and planning for many scenarios. There is a profound understanding of what is at stake for Yale, higher education, and the world. Despite the great uncertainty ahead of us, we affirm our commitment to the crucial work you do to create and share knowledge, promote the free exchange of ideas, and serve society.\n\nThank you for your part in carefully stewarding Yale’s resources as we navigate this challenging time together. As we learn and know more, we will provide additional updates, keeping you informed of plans to preserve and protect our mission.\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Strobel\n\nProvost and Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry\n\nJack Callahan, Jr.\n\nSenior Vice President for Operations\n\nStephen Murphy\n\nVice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer",

    "content": "[Summary: Beginning with the Class of 2029, Yale College will increase its class size by 100 students per year, for a total of 1650 students per class. In addition to expanding the undergraduate population, Yale will make investments to support the Yale College experience and areas of the university that contribute to its strength.]\n\nTo: Faculty in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science; Students in Yale College; Staff in Yale College, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and all administrative and operational units\n\nDear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nThroughout its history, Yale College has educated promising individuals for leadership and service, preparing them for lifetimes of engaged citizenship. Today, we are pleased to announce the university’s commitment to making this education available to more students—those who will go on to serve in every corner of the world and every sector of society. Beginning with this fall’s entering Class of 2029, Yale College will increase its class size by 100 students per year, for a total of 1650 students per class. Over time, this growth will bring the total undergraduate population to 6600. This number is slightly lower than current enrollment, which is larger than usual due to COVID-19-related deferrals.\n\nThis increase, approved by Yale’s board of trustees, follows conversations with faculty, staff, and students on the challenges and opportunities of a larger Yale College. We are grateful to everyone who participated in these discussions, particularly the two faculty-led committees that assessed needs and made recommendations for implementing a larger class size.\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of qualified applicants apply for admission to Yale College, far more than the university has had the capacity to accept. By making investments to welcome more of these talented students, Yale College will advance its strategic plan, providing the benefits of a Yale education to additional future leaders with a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives. This expansion also provides an opportunity to enhance the undergraduate experience and build on the strengths of the residential college system, where students develop their intellectual, moral, civic, and creative capacities in community with faculty and peers.\n\nOf course, a Yale College education is possible only through the efforts of faculty, staff, and graduate students, as well as the services required to support both them and the residential education of undergraduates. Therefore, plans to expand the student body will include additional resources and staff to facilitate student activities and campus life. This will ensure that all students continue to receive the opportunities that for years have made Yale College unique. Together with commitments to the Yale College community, the university will also make broader investments. We believe this is a moment to bolster both the entire undergraduate experience and the many areas of the university that contribute to the college’s strength.\n\nYale’s faculty are a tremendous asset to Yale College. In addition to carrying out world-class research and scholarship, they demonstrate an incredible commitment to teaching and learning. They also play a vital role in shaping an innovative curriculum that draws on Yale’s distinctive strengths in the arts, humanities, social sciences, science, and engineering. To support an excellent and robust faculty, the university previously announced investments to expand the faculty’s size. In 2022, Yale allocated 45 additional faculty positions to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). As a result, FAS and SEAS have engaged in significant hiring and continue to work toward a target of more than 750 tenure-track and tenured positions. To further support a larger Yale College class size, the university will increase the faculty target size by five additional positions—four in the FAS and one in SEAS. These positions will be available to the deans of the FAS and SEAS to address pressing needs and student interest.\n\nIn addition to investments in faculty positions, the university will commit additional resources to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. These resources will help offset the cost of supporting graduate students, an expense often borne by individual faculty members’ research grants. Sustaining a robust graduate student community is crucial to the university’s education and research missions and to a thriving Yale College. Graduate students serve as teaching assistants, supervise undergraduate research, provide mentorship to Yale College students, and deepen scholarship. Additional information about support for graduate students will be shared shortly.\n\nFinally, while increasing the Yale College class size, the university will maintain its commitment to admitting exceptional students regardless of their financial resources. Yale will continue to meet 100 percent of students’ demonstrated financial need. Our world-leading programs in admissions and undergraduate financial aid will continue to attract and provide access to an outstanding group of students each year.\n\nAgain, we thank the many colleagues who have offered guidance and strategic insights, including the Yale College Admissions and Financial Aid Policy Committee, the FAS-SEAS Senate, residential college heads and deans, department chairs, and directors of undergraduate studies, as well as the Yale College faculty, who have discussed this plan at several faculty meetings over the past two years. We are especially grateful to all these groups not only for exploring ways to meet the logistical needs of a larger undergraduate population, but also for asking how Yale College can strengthen the education it provides to its students. We also wish to acknowledge the critical partnership offered by Deans Steven Wilkinson, Lynn Cooley, and Jeff Brock, whose leadership helps make this increased class size possible.\n\nAttending Yale College is a transformative experience that prepares students for leadership and service in every sphere of human activity. Each member of the Yale community plays a role in shaping that experience. As we share our excitement at the news that more students from around the world will benefit from a Yale College education, we also share our gratitude for everyone who advances Yale’s mission.\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Strobel\n\nProvost\n\nHenry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry\n\nPericles Lewis\n\nDean of Yale College\n\nDouglas Tracy Smith Professor of Comparative Literature",

A new webpage contains guidance from federal agencies and will continue to be updated as more information becomes available.]\n\nDear Faculty Colleagues,\n\nAs President McInnis and Provost Strobel wrote to the community last week, the university is actively monitoring executive orders, policies, and guidelines issued by the new federal administration. This includes actions that impact the critical research we conduct at Yale. I write to provide information based on what we know today and to share developing resources.\n\nThe administration’s January 27, 2025 memorandum calling for a temporary pause on disbursement of grants and loans issued by the federal government has been rescinded. However, the executive orders affecting sponsored research remain in place and are under court review, and federal agencies are sharing individual directives. To provide as much clarity as possible at this time, the Research at Yale website has been updated with guidance from various federal agencies. My office will continue to post information as it becomes available. If you have questions that are not addressed or insights you would like to share, please write to the Office of Sponsored Projects at osphelp@yale.edu. Your questions and examples of how new federal policy is impacting your research will inform how we can assist you moving forward.\n\nThis is a dynamic situation that has created uncertainty for researchers at Yale and across the country. I share the same concerns that many of you have expressed to me over the last two weeks. I want to reassure you that faculty administrators and colleagues from the Offices of the Vice Provost for Research, Sponsored Projects, General Counsel, and Federal and State Relations as well as representatives from deans’ offices are meeting regularly to interpret developments and issue guidance as quickly and clearly as possible. I will continue to share significant updates as they become available. Please also check the Research at Yale website, which we will continue to develop and update.\n\nThe research we conduct at Yale, in partnership with federal agencies, is critical to improving the human condition. You have my support—and the support of leaders across campus—for the work you do to advance Yale’s mission and make discoveries that benefit humanity.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael C.

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nIn these final weeks of the academic year, our campus has welcomed thousands of admitted and prospective students. It’s a time when new scholars—filled with hopes and dreams for the future—see firsthand everything that makes Yale a wonderful place to learn and call home: a brilliant student body, a renowned faculty, a dedicated staff, and a community where people and ideas can flourish.\n\nFor centuries, these qualities have made Yale a model for scholarly excellence and a powerful engine of progress and discovery, touching communities across the nation and around the globe. Our research has saved lives. Our scholarship and teaching have driven human progress and expanded human understanding. Our innovations have kept America competitive and strengthened its standing in the world.\n\nA major driver of this success is our longstanding partnership with the federal government and the support of the American people. For decades, the government and universities have worked together to invest in critical research and foster innovation. It’s hard to overstate the tremendous impact of this collaboration. From lifesaving cancer treatments and antibiotics to touchscreens, GPS, and the very internet you’re using to read this email, federally supported research being done at universities has fueled prosperity and improved quality of life in virtually every aspect of our society.\n\nBut none of this progress would have been possible without our fidelity to two fundamental principles: free expression and intellectual freedom. These aren’t just buzzwords. They’re cornerstones of both our campus and our country, and they have helped make American higher education the envy of the world.\n\nSo, it’s fitting that at a time of national dialogue about free expression, Yale is marking the fiftieth anniversary of the landmark Woodward Report, which codified our commitment to the free exchange of ideas. This anniversary has given us a chance to reaffirm the importance of free expression to our campus and the world of higher education.\n\nThe ideals described in the report are the lifeblood of any community of curiosity and learning dedicated to academic excellence. That’s why I am working with my colleagues throughout higher education and within the Association of American Universities to speak for those values. In addition, I am committed to advocating for other aspects of higher education at every turn—including bolstering support for research and making universities more affordable and accessible. I also am focused on addressing the significant decline in confidence in higher education across partisan divides. Doing so requires all of us to reflect with humility and engage openly with both our critics and our supporters. As I have done throughout my career, I will uphold academic freedom and continue to work in support of an independent higher education sector, which I believe firmly is a strategic asset of our nation.\n\nOf course, I am not in this alone. I know all of you share these commitments. And as we wrap up this term and look toward the next one, I know we will keep working together to advance Yale’s mission and sustain a vibrant intellectual environment, across differences in views and cultures. After all, we are a community, and being part of a community comes with a responsibility to treat each other with dignity and respect, even—and especially—when we disagree. Diverse viewpoints are welcome. Spirited debate is encouraged. But we can have disagreement and debate without disparagement.\n\nWe do so, in part, by following the rule of law and university policies. These policies—such as neutral time, place, and manner guidelines—do not favor any particular group or viewpoint. They are designed to maintain the essential functioning of our university and the safety of all our students, faculty, staff, and visitors. We must protect the right of everyone on our campus to study and work free from discrimination, intimidation, or harassment of any kind, on any platform, and we will continue to amend and adjust policies and guidelines to that end.\n\nThe last year has not been without its challenges, and the year ahead will surely bring new ones. And yet, I can’t help but feel optimistic. So many of you have engaged with me over the past ten months, offering creative and compelling ideas for how Yale can better fulfill our mission through reflection and continuous improvement, expand our impact, and stay true to our promise of free expression and intellectual freedom. Your thoughtful comments and suggestions have not only supported my work, but they have also informed my discussions with alumni, colleagues, and others across the country—from Dallas and D.C. to Miami and San Francisco.\n\nNo matter what the future holds, we will meet it as we always have: as a community. For more than three centuries, Yale has not only weathered but emerged stronger from every storm. We have done so not by letting change or challenge tear us apart, but by coming together to solve problems and keep us moving forward. Our capacity to work together and listen to each other—our sense of shared responsibility and commitment to Yale’s mission—is our greatest asset. It is the light that illuminates our path forward, and it is inextinguishable. I am proud to carry that light with all of you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nToday, I write to announce that I have convened a Committee on Trust in Higher Education as we all work together to shape Yale’s future.\n\nSince assuming this office last summer, I have attended over 100 meetings on campus and had countless conversations with Yale students, faculty, alumni, and staff about the most pressing issues facing our university. Over and over, I heard one of my deepest concerns echoed back to me: namely, that the precipitous drop in esteem for higher education imperils life-saving research, scholarship that expands human potential and understanding, and economic strength generated by colleges and universities across the country.\n\nOur nation’s universities make vital contributions to American society. Faculty, students, and staff conduct pioneering research and contribute to transformative educational experiences across all fields of knowledge. They think together about sources of past wisdom and push the boundaries of today’s received thought. More than two million students complete college and graduate school across the U.S. each year, going on to significant careers in both public and private sectors.\n\nYet confidence in higher education is at an all-time low across the political spectrum. According to the latest Gallup data, a third of U.S. adults have little to no confidence in higher education, and more than two-thirds believe it is heading in the wrong direction. These sentiments cross partisan divides. They encompass many critiques.\n\nTo address them, those of us who care about the future of American colleges and universities must engage in the sort of open discourse and self-reflection that is—and should be—a hallmark of the best forms of higher education. The free exchange of ideas is foundational to the mission of any university. However, self-censorship has become an increasing concern on many campuses, including Yale’s.\n\n\n\nAt this defining moment in higher education, it is imperative to understand the erosion of trust in colleges and universities nationwide. As they come under attack in the public square, universities must redouble commitments to academic freedom and free speech. At the same time, they cannot operate sealed off from the society in which they are embedded, and which they were established to serve. The future of American higher education depends on a restoration of public trust and legitimacy.\n\nThis new committee will undertake a process of reckoning and reflection, and I am grateful that Julia Adams, Margaret H. Marshall Professor of Sociology, and Beverly Gage, John Lewis Gaddis Professor of History, have agreed to serve as its co-chairs. A full list of committee members and a form to share your thoughts with the group can be found on the committee’s website.\n\nI will charge the committee to draw on the knowledge and experience of experts, citizens, and scholars—including members of the Yale faculty—to better understand public perception and envision ways of strengthening trust in higher education. The committee will engage the Yale community as well as its outside critics. It will invite external experts with varied viewpoints and backgrounds to provide perspective and to weigh how best to address the erosion of trust in higher education. It will explore possibilities for enhancing the open exchange of ideas on campus, in the classroom and beyond.\n\nI look forward to working together to confront this challenging moment; this community is Yale’s strength, and I want to thank you for your engagement on this issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor in the History of Art\n\nYale University",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nI am delighted to share the news that Niko Pfund will be the next director of Yale University Press, effective July 1, 2025.\n\nNiko joins Yale from Oxford University Press (OUP), where he has held a variety of roles over the last two decades and most recently served as global academic publisher and president of its U.S. division. In that time, he has had a hand in—and demonstrated a keen acumen for—all aspects of modern academic publishing. While overseeing hundreds of colleagues across two offices in the United States, he has pursued fruitful and creative partnerships, expanded OUP’s distribution capabilities, and supported both digital growth and innovative marketplace opportunities. Prior to his work at OUP, Niko was director and editor in chief of New York University Press, where he doubled its size and elevated its profile.\n\nWe have found in Niko a leader who prizes the time-honored tenets of rigorous scholarship and bold, future-oriented thinking in equal measure. He brings with him an immersive understanding of scholarly publishing and serious non-fiction as well as a proven track record, with experience in broadening the mandate of an academic press while abiding closely by its vital mission of contributing to a global understanding of human affairs. Importantly to me, he also has a sterling reputation as a wonderful colleague and has shepherded OUP with a focus on community-building and responsible stewardship.\n\nA deep believer in the power and impact of longform scholarship, Niko has served as a mentor in publishing programs affiliated with Oxford University, Columbia University, Pace University, Amherst College, and the Association of University Presses, among others. He has also been an active member of numerous boards, affiliated with both academic and service-oriented institutions, including the governing board of Stanford University Press, the advisory board of the George Washington University Graduate Program in Publishing, and the board of directors of the Digital Public Library of America.\n\nNiko joins us at a time when our ambitions for Yale University Press are growing, as we seek to build on the strong groundwork that John Donatich, the outgoing director of the Press, has laid. With his thoughtfulness and precision, Niko is well-equipped to help us realize these aims.\n\nThroughout the search process, we were fortunate to receive feedback from many members of the Yale community, who had ideas and insights about the future of Yale University Press and the role that it can play in elevating longform scholarship in the public consciousness. The search advisory committee commended Niko as someone who not only echoed many of the recommendations we heard, but also has the finesse and aptitude necessary to implement them. I am grateful to everyone who participated in this process and to the members of the search advisory committee, chaired by Yale University Press Board of Governors Chair David Wan ’76, for their meticulousness and care. I also want to extend my profound gratitude to John Donatich, who has served this institution with distinction.\n\nPlease join me in celebrating Niko as he steps into his new role. I know his vision for Yale University Press will see it grow and help it to reach new audiences. I look forward to working with him as he leads the Press to even greater heights both here in New Haven and in London.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nFollowing twenty-three years of leadership at Yale, James Bundy has informed us that he will retire from his positions as Elizabeth Parker Ware Dean of David Geffen School of Drama at Yale and artistic director of Yale Repertory Theatre on June 30, 2026. Though he will be deeply missed in these roles, we are grateful that he will continue to teach at both David Geffen School of Drama (DGSD) and Yale College.\n\nJames’s long service to DGSD is unprecedented—no prior dean of the school has held the role as long. His tenure is marked by outstanding achievements as an artist, administrator, teacher, and fundraiser. In addition, his visionary leadership has fostered extraordinary advancements in graduate conservatory theater education and professional practice, fundamentally transforming DGSD and Yale Rep and positioning both institutions for ongoing preeminence in the field.\n\nPerhaps the most profound hallmark of James’s tenure is his contribution to the remarkable philanthropic support for the dramatic arts at Yale, which has expanded student access to premiere theater education. Since becoming dean, he has played a lead role in establishing seventy of the school’s ninety-one named scholarships, and in 2008, DGSD began offering students in the playwriting program fully funded tuition and living expense stipends. Most significantly, in 2021, the school received $150 million from the David Geffen Foundation—the largest single gift in the history of the American theater—eliminating tuition for all degree and certificate students in perpetuity.\n\nIn his role as dean, James has transformed the leadership structure of the school, recruiting associate and assistant deans of diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences to support strategic and operational planning. He has welcomed to Yale eminent theater artists and managers to teaching and leadership roles, appointing all ten chairs of the school’s programs of study. To ensure the continued vitality of the relationship between Yale Rep, the school, its alumni, and the field, he has cultivated DGSD’s Board of Advisors, established in 2002 and comprised of leaders, including alumni, from a wide variety of disciplines.\n\nJames’s strong leadership was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. When in-person gathering became incompatible with producing live theater, the school temporarily lengthened its three-year MFA program to four years. This additional year was fully subsidized by the school and provided students with meaningful production assignments, a core tenet of the school’s conservatory training. James’s care for theater makers and audiences has also resulted in new training and production practices, creating a community of students, faculty, and staff who promote an environment of mutual respect, dialogue, and continuous learning.\n\nAs artistic director of Yale Repertory Theatre, James has immeasurably enriched the cultural life not only of our campus and our city, but of the American theater at large. Since his appointment, ten Yale Rep plays and musicals have been honored with the Outstanding Production of the Year Award by the Connecticut Critics Circle. The organization has also recognized James with the Tom Killen Award, for his lifetime of dedication to the theater and to theater in Connecticut, and the Outstanding Direction Award for his revelatory staging of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, one of a dozen critically-acclaimed productions of canonical works he has directed at Yale Rep.\n\nIn 2008, under James’s direction, Yale’s Binger Center for New Theatre was established, becoming one of the nation’s most robust and innovative programs to develop and underwrite new plays. Throughout his Yale career, James has produced four world-premiere plays that advanced to Broadway, collectively receiving a total of eleven Tony nominations and two Tony Awards. Two other plays were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama.\n\nOver the past two decades, the work of field-leading visiting artists has graced the Yale Rep stage. To foster meaningful connections between the distinguished guest artists working at Yale Rep and DGSD students, James established the Beinecke Fellows program, inviting current legends into lectures and classes with theater’s next generation.\n\nFurther, James has relentlessly worked to advance the school’s historic claim of unparalleled excellence by improving its facilities. To date, he has collaborated with other university leaders to raise more than $100 million toward a new Dramatic Arts Building. This landmark facility will serve as home to David Geffen School of Drama at Yale, Yale Repertory Theatre, and the undergraduate Program in Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies. It will also provide dedicated rehearsal space for the Yale Dramatic Association.\n\nThis spring, the provost’s office will form a search advisory committee to help us identify candidates for the next dean of DGSD. We will keep the school’s community informed as the search process takes shape and opportunities to provide input are organized.\n\nWe offer profound gratitude to James for the myriad ways he has transformed the dramatic arts at Yale over these last two decades. We estimate that more than 1,500 students have received a world-class theater education under his leadership—and scores of faculty, staff, alumni, artists, and visitors have benefitted from his dedication to making Yale a center of theatrical excellence.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor in the History of Art\n\nScott Strobel\n\nProvost\n\nHenry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry",

Beginning July 1, 2025, he will step away from this position, while remaining a member of the faculty. He will return to the directorship on July 1, 2026.\n\nDuring his leave, David will pursue research on the evolutionary responses of biodiversity to a changing climate. The project draws on twenty-nine years of data he has collected at the Yale-Myers Forest.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that Erika Edwards, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, will serve as acting director of the Peabody during David’s leave. As curator of botany at the Peabody Museum since she joined Yale in 2017, Erika is well-versed in the museum’s community and collections. As director of Yale’s Marsh Botanical Garden, she is also experienced in steering plans to support a university-wide resource for research, instruction, and education. Her own research focuses on plant evolution, using a wide range of biological data to understand the many ways plant species have adapted their form and function over time.\n\nWe wish David a productive year of research, beginning in July, and look forward to welcoming him back to his post. We are also grateful to Erika for stepping in to lead the museum at such an exciting time in its history.

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Library Community,\n\nWe are delighted to announce the reappointment of Barbara Rockenbach as the Stephen F. Gates ’68 University Librarian. This renewal, approved by the Yale Corporation, recognizes Barbara’s success over the past four and a half years in supporting innovative research and teaching for students, faculty, and researchers. During her tenure, she has enhanced educational and data infrastructures and increased access to the library’s iconic spaces and collections.\n\nBarbara’s impact began almost immediately upon her arrival at Yale in 2020. As the university navigated the pandemic, Barbara embraced the challenge of adapting library services, while ensuring that the libraries were among the first spaces to reopen to students. Many innovations adopted during this time—including improved remote access to library resources, expanded online offerings, and book delivery by mail—have become part of the library’s regular services, benefitting users across campus and advancing priorities such as collection digitization.\n\nIn addition to enhancing library services, Barbara has improved the library’s technology infrastructure, crucial to providing necessary tools and platforms for research and enriching the academic experience for students and faculty. Following an evaluation of the existing technology supporting all library operations and services, she introduced the first phase of a multi-year migration to a more modern system, which will be implemented in July.\n\nThe new system will also underpin emerging forms of research support. Partnering with colleagues across campus, Barbara developed a multi-year strategy to increase support for data-intensive research for all disciplines. Under her leadership, the library established the Computational Methods and Data (CMD) department and formed shared-staff partnerships with the Data-Intensive Social Science Center and the Center for Geospatial Solutions. Most recently, the library launched the Yale Dataverse—a critical new technology infrastructure to acquire, make available, and preserve data sets—and library staff are collaborating with the Poorvu Center and other campus partners to develop AI tools, guidance, and support.\n\nWhile identifying and responding to emerging research needs, Barbara has also invested in Yale Library’s historic strengths. Under her leadership, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library has been reorganized to support cross-collection collaboration, new technology infrastructure, and shared best practices among the seven special collections at Yale Library (Arts, Beinecke, Divinity, Medical Historical, Manuscripts & Archives, Music, and Lewis Walpole.) This reorganization has advanced the library’s outreach and partnerships in New Haven and introduced new approaches to steward the collections in a manner that meets current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.\n\nBarbara has also reaffirmed Yale Library’s continued commitment—matched by only a few university libraries in the world—to collecting, preserving, and providing access to print collections. To support this commitment, Yale Library recently joined Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, and the research division of the New York Public Library in the ReCAP storage and access consortium. In addition to long-term storage options for print collections, ReCAP provides immediate, seamless access to a shared collection of 8 million new and unique titles that Yale does not currently own.\n\nLooking toward Sterling Memorial Library’s centennial in 2031, Barbara is leading the library in evaluating ways to meet the evolving needs of students, faculty, and staff. This work is already underway. Through programming and spaces, including the creation of the Hanke Gallery and the renovation of the Linonia and Brothers Room, Barbara has reinforced the library’s central role in fostering community and supporting the academic enterprise on our campus.\n\nWe are grateful to all those who informed our reappointment decision with their thoughtful comments. Colleagues from across the university expressed appreciation for Barbara’s ability to both honor the historic significance of Yale Library and introduce innovations that support the continued growth of educational, research, and cross-disciplinary programs at Yale.

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nI write to share the news that after nearly a decade of distinguished leadership at Yale, Jack Callahan, senior vice president for operations, intends to retire this year. During his tenure, Jack has given his utmost to this institution. I am grateful he has agreed to continue serving until I complete the search process for a successor—a testament to his unwavering dedication.\n\nJack’s contributions to Yale are immeasurable. His strategic vision and steadfast leadership have helped to advance the university’s mission and enhance our reputation as a global leader in higher education. Notably, Jack’s portfolio extends to the whole of Yale, encompassing facilities, campus development, and sustainability; finance and administration; human resources; technology and campus services; and New Haven affairs and university properties, among other departments. The energy Jack has devoted to each of these core functions has not limited his ability to excel in all of them.\n\nSince inaugurating his role in 2016, Jack has guided Yale toward realizing our ambitious university priorities. During a period of historic growth, our campus has increased the undergraduate student body by over 15 percent; expanded support for all faculty, students, and staff; and grown our research and teaching capacity by thousands of square feet of new and renovated spaces. Overall, the university’s operating budget for the fiscal year 2025 surpasses $6 billion in support of our people, programs, and projects; this is more than a 75 percent increase since Jack began his service at Yale.\n\nAs Jack oversaw significant, sustained growth, he also demonstrated exceptional agility in the face of unprecedented challenges. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, he rapidly adapted every aspect of the university’s operations to ensure the continuity of our mission, all while prioritizing the health and safety of our community. As the pandemic eased, Jack worked closely with faculty and staff across the university to foster the operational resilience vital to Yale’s return to full, in-person teaching and learning.\n\nJack’s service to Yale and to New Haven has been a true labor of love, rooted in his deep connection to both communities. A Yale College alumnus and third-generation New Havener, Jack’s personal dedication to his alma mater and hometown shines through his many achievements. He shaped Yale’s historic $140 million investment in New Haven and launched the OneFinance initiative to simplify and standardize financial functions across the university; the Learning Strategic Initiative to position Yale as a leader in employee learning and development, further reinforcing our reputation as a workplace of choice; and the Recruiting Initiative to modernize and simplify Yale’s staff hiring process, enhancing our ability to attract a highly talented workforce. There perhaps has been no better person to oversee such a sprawling set of responsibilities, each reflecting Jack’s commitment to the community he holds dear.\n\nThroughout his service, Jack’s focus on employee development has extended beyond policy and programs. He personally hired, mentored, and elevated many members of the university’s senior leadership team, providing them with the tools and opportunities to thrive. His efforts to identify, nurture, and advance emerging talent have fostered a new generation of leaders poised to carry forward his legacy of excellence.\n\nI will soon launch a search for Jack’s successor. Jack’s many accomplishments serve not only Yale’s immediate operational needs but also lay a strong foundation for future innovation and enhancements that will support faculty, students, and staff working to realize Yale’s mission.\n\nPlease join me in thanking Jack for his outstanding service to Yale. He will always be part of the Yale community, and I look forward to the work we will do together with the operations team in the months ahead.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale University Community,\n\nOn February 7, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a notice capping indirect costs, also known as facilities and administrative costs (F&A), at 15 percent. That is more than a 75 percent decrease from the current rate the federal government set for Yale. This decision poses a considerable threat to Yale’s research endeavors, which lead to medical breakthroughs, support patients in clinical trials, and drive economic growth. Currently, indirect costs support the facilities and infrastructure that enable more than 38,000 patients to participate in over 2,000 research trials. Among these clinical trials, 280 are focused on cancer therapy, eighty involve mental health and behavioral care, and fifty are related to heart disease.\n\nThis cap on indirect costs directly harms Yale’s core research mission and our scientists’ ability to discover life-saving cures for people across the country and the world. Since the moment I learned of this news, I have been working with my colleagues at America’s leading research universities to explore all options to oppose this action. Earlier today, Yale and more than thirty other universities and university systems provided public declarations in support of a case filed by the attorneys general of twenty-two states asking the courts to issue a temporary restraining order blocking the reduced indirect cost rate from taking effect.\n\nWe also are working with peer institutions in other ways to explain to lawmakers that indirect costs are research costs. They include expenses necessary for our research efforts, such as building maintenance, utilities, compliance with federal regulations, lab safety, and the salaries of staff who provide essential clinical and laboratory services. These expenditures ensure that our facilities remain operational and safe, allowing our faculty and students to focus on patient care and research.\n\nYale does not profit from federal indirect cost reimbursements, which cover the actual expenses incurred in supporting federally funded research as determined through negotiations with the government and ongoing audits. These negotiated rates reflect the true costs of maintaining a world-class research environment.\n\nOur commitment to research is unwavering, demonstrated by significant financial contributions from our own institutional funds. In FY 2024, Yale invested $432 million in research—more than double the amount received in indirect cost reimbursements from the NIH. While our endowment provides critical support for research, it is not a limitless resource. Most of the endowment is legally restricted to specific uses, and the rest supports core priorities, such as financial aid and long-term investments in research infrastructure.\n\nReducing indirect cost recovery jeopardizes the symbiotic relationship between universities and the federal government that advances national interests. For decades, this partnership has been instrumental in achieving better health, enhanced quality of life, and economic growth. Curtailing funding threatens not just academic and research communities but also the well-being of our nation. It could impede progress on U.S. medical priorities that introduce improved treatments; slow scientific progress; result in fewer jobs; hinder economic growth; and diminish our global competitiveness.\n\nGiven the rapid pace of changes coming from Washington, D.C., we will keep you informed through the leaders of each affected area and related online resources, such as the webpage for research.\n\nKnow that I am committed to advancing the mission of our university and to advocating for you and our larger higher education community. I will always work in ways that are most effective, in public or behind the scenes.\n\nOur work realizing Yale’s mission of education, research, preservation, and practice is essential. Every day, we contribute to the creation of knowledge and the application of that knowledge to benefit humanity. Together, we will continue this work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale School of Medicine Community,\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the Yale Corporation has approved the reappointment of Nancy J. Brown, MD, Jean and David W. Wallace Dean of Medicine and C.N.H. Long Professor of Internal Medicine, as dean of the Yale School of Medicine (YSM) for a second term of five years, effective July 1, 2025. This renewal recognizes Dean Brown’s success over the past five years in leading the advancement of the school’s mission and in elevating its national and global reputation.\n\nYale is fortunate to have brought on such a distinguished leader, scientist, and clinician in March 2020 – just moments before the start of a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic. We are thankful for Nancy’s leadership and guidance in helping the school, university, and medical community navigate this complex time. We are also grateful to the YSM community for its expertise, hard work, and contributions in making the past five years a time of progress and transformation.\n\nSince 2020, YSM has made advances critical to building a vibrant community of future leaders in medicine and science. Under Nancy’s leadership, the school has reached important milestones toward its goal of providing a debt-free medical education for all individuals with demonstrated financial need, and in 2023, the school announced a pledged gift of $25 million from the Starr Foundation. This funding, together with the development of innovative alumni outreach initiatives, has enhanced the school’s ability to recruit extraordinary students from across the country and world. Recently, YSM also has expanded resources to support faculty in balancing their teaching responsibilities, enhanced institutional funding for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and revamped the Master of Health Sciences program.\n\nTo nurture creativity and dialogue, the school has renovated space for students to study and connect with their classmates, residents, fellows, faculty, and alumni. Further fostering an inclusive learning community, the school launched six student advisory houses to provide academic and career advising and to facilitate mentorship, research opportunities, and career exploration for students. Recognizing its high quality and integrity, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education reaccredited YSM’s educational program for another eight years in 2023.\n\nNancy has also led important advancements in YSM’s clinical mission. Over the last five years, YSM has collaborated with Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS) to create the first joint strategic plan, outlining the alignment of their operations, care delivery, and initiatives. A critical milestone in this work was the creation of a new Aligned Clinician Enterprise that partners YSM and YNHHS clinicians in delivering care that meets the highest standards of quality, safety, and efficiency. In addition, YSM and YNHHS enacted a new funds flow model, which increases reinvestment in research and clinical care. Now established as physicians-in-chiefs across the health system, the YSM clinical chairs are joining with other leaders in the system to optimize care in their respective specialties.\n\nMeanwhile, YSM has expanded its research capacity and impact. Nancy has led the school to secure increased research funding and recruit world-renowned scientists, clinicians, and leaders. As part of an overarching space plan, YSM developed research space at 100 College Street, 300 George Street, and 101 College Street, while continuing to build core technologies, clinical research infrastructure, and tools for emerging areas such as artificial intelligence. YSM also has diversified ways to support faculty research, such as by joining the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub NY, and has established numerous programs and centers to advance the school’s mission and realize the broader university science strategy.\n\nDuring the reappointment review process, we received a wide range of comments and ideas from the YSM community, and we are grateful to all who took the time to participate. Many expressed appreciation for Nancy’s highly principled leadership style and commitment to YSM’s mission. Members of the YSM community were particularly pleased with the school’s progress in increasing support for medical education, transforming clinical operations, and promoting innovative and collaborative research.\n\nNancy has told us that the heart of YSM’s mission is its community. In her second term, she will redouble her commitment to listen to the YSM community to foster an environment that values, respects, and leverages everyone’s strengths. We are confident that Nancy’s continued leadership will steer YSM through both challenge and celebration, advancing your work to improve the health of all people.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art\n\nScott Strobel\n\nProvost\n\nHenry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nWe are aware that many of you have questions about how the changes coming from the new administration in Washington, D.C., will affect your research, studies, and work at Yale. We want to assure you that we are actively working to understand the implications of any new policies, guidelines, and priorities, including the internal federal memorandum from yesterday that ordered federal agencies to temporarily pause grants and loans issued by the government.\n\nThe implementation of these changes will depend on interpretation by federal agencies and courts, so we do not have clear answers today on how this and other government actions will affect our university. However, based on guidance issued this afternoon by the Office of Management and Budget, this “pause” appears to be focused on specific programs mentioned in the memo and does not broadly affect grants or programs that provide direct benefits to individuals, such as Pell Grants and student loans.\n\nYale faculty, staff, and students should continue federally funded work except for cases where the university has received specific stop-work orders. In the meantime, we should all be mindful of the impact of university spending in light of these uncertainties.\n\nPlease know that we are focused on supporting our community and advocating for higher education and Yale. In recent days, we have continued to engage in discussions with legislators about the critical importance of the partnership between the federal government and institutions of higher education. This partnership has been essential in enhancing and extending lives, driving economic growth, enriching communities, and bolstering national competitiveness.\n\nThis week, we have asked faculty and staff on campus with expertise in federal funding, laws, and policies to focus on understanding the executive orders and announcements around specific areas that affect our students, faculty, and staff, as well as our research and teaching. We will communicate significant updates, including any changes that may be necessary to be compliant with evolving requirements, and you will also hear from deans and other campus leaders when they have news to share.\n\nOur mission is to create, share, and preserve knowledge; to educate and inspire students; and to apply our discoveries to address the world’s greatest challenges. We are committed to navigating these times with a steadfast focus on advancing that mission and on supporting members of our community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art\n\nScott Strobel\n\nProvost\n\nHenry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Yale Community,\n\nI am pleased to share the news that Martina Droth will be the next Paul Mellon Director of the Yale Center for British Art (YCBA), effective January 15, 2025.\n\nMartina, deputy director and chief curator of the YCBA, has been an integral part of the museum—and an active member of the Yale community—for the past sixteen years. In that time, she has built an impressive record of achievement through roles of increasing responsibility, from leading the research division and serving as curator of sculpture to her current post. Prior to the YCBA, she taught at universities and coordinated research and curated exhibitions for major art institutes in the UK. A former chair of the Association of Research Institutes in Art History, Martina has a deep commitment to the field, characterized by collaborative leadership and excellence in curatorial practice, research, and education.\n\nThe YCBA will benefit from being led by an art historian and curator who has been instrumental in its success. Martina has been a driving force behind YCBA’s long-range strategy for research, collections, and exhibitions. She is now playing a vital role in reimagining the YCBA’s collection installation and conceiving a new curatorial program in readiness for the museum’s reopening in spring 2025.\n\nUnder Martina’s direction, the YCBA will continue to advance its mission of promoting the understanding and appreciation of British art through its exceptional collections, groundbreaking exhibitions, field-defining research, and innovative public programs. In partnership with staff, faculty, and students, she will further enhance educational initiatives, expand community engagement, and foster an intellectual environment that welcomes a breadth of perspectives to be part of the discourse in art and art history. She also will build on the YCBA’s partnerships with Yale’s academic departments to augment the museum’s national and international collaborations and outreach.\n\nMartina has curated numerous high-profile exhibitions, including “Bill Brandt | Henry Moore,” “Sculpture Victorious: Art in an Age of Invention, 1837–1901,” and the forthcoming exhibitions marking YCBA’s reopening year, “Tracey Emin: I Loved You Until the Morning” and “Hew Locke: Passages.” She has secured resources that support the museum’s scholarly initiatives, such as the multi-year Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grants with which she developed the research strategy at the YCBA. Her efforts advancing the YCBA’s mission have often involved collaborative efforts with renowned external institutions such as Tate Britain, the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge University, and the Getty Museum.\n\nMartina’s work at Yale extends well beyond the YCBA. She has served on committees, including the Committee for Art in Public Spaces; co-taught courses with History of Art faculty at Yale; and brought graduate students into curatorial research. She oversaw the YCBA’s first joint exhibition with the Yale School of Architecture and facilitated projects integrating visiting artists with students at the Yale School of Art. She has mentored numerous curators, students, and postdoctoral fellows who have gone on to careers in the academy and museum fields. Her academic work includes many service roles, including co-editing the British Art Studies journal with the Paul Mellon Centre.\n\nMartina’s success over the years is due in large part to her dedication to fostering a culture of collaboration and inclusion. A proponent of building partnerships with local communities, Martina has developed programs to connect broad audiences with Yale’s collections. She initiated “The View from Here: Accessing Art Through Photography,” a program for New Haven high school students, in collaboration with the Lens Media Lab at the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage. She has introduced New Haven Promise students into the Curatorial Division of the YCBA and created internship opportunities for undergraduates, such as through the Association of Research Institutes in Art History.\n\nDuring the search process, many members of the Yale community sent suggestions for candidates and ideas for the future of the YCBA. The search advisory committee and I benefited from the comments we received, as we looked internationally for the best leader to take the helm of the YCBA. Based on the insights we gathered, Martina is the ideal leader for the YCBA. I thank all those who thoughtfully provided their recommendation, and I am grateful to the members of the search advisory committee, chaired by Professor Ned Cooke, for their care in soliciting comments from the community and for the thoughtful ways they considered all the ideas they collected. I also appreciate deeply Richard Brodhead, ninth president of Duke University and former dean of Yale College, for his exceptional leadership as the interim director of the YCBA.\n\nI hope you will join me in congratulating Martina on her new role and in supporting her as she prepares to lead the YCBA. I look forward to working with her as she steers the museum toward new heights in realizing its mission and makes it an ever more welcoming space that offers inspiring experiences with art and deepens our engagement with students, scholars, New Haven residents, and visitors from around the world.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art",

    "content": "The following message was emailed to Middlebury faculty and staff on May 12.\n\nTo Our Community,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, we write to acknowledge the financial challenges we face as an institution and the impact that addressing those challenges has on you. While this is our first open letter to the community on the issue, it is far from our first engagement in this work. For a board, no job is more important and no responsibility greater than ensuring that the organization we serve is in sound fiscal health, today and for decades to come. That is why last winter we directed the administration to create a plan to eliminate Middlebury’s long-standing structural deficit by balancing budgets in the College and Schools as we continue to deal separately with the finances of the Institute.\n\nAs trustees, we have been giving our utmost attention to this effort, which we initiated well before the assault on higher education. That said, the executive orders out of Washington over the past several months have required us to focus intensely on those issues as well. We know that an already difficult climb could become significantly steeper if our endowment were to be taxed above its current rate, or if we lost all federal support for research and student aid.\n\nThese issues—along with defending our core principles of academic freedom and free expression—will continue to be our top priorities through the months ahead.\n\nThe board’s Executive Committee—along with the chairs and vice chairs of the Resources, Strategy and Programs, and Risk Committees—have been briefed every step of the way by members of the senior administration, and we want you to know that we are all invested in this work. All trustees, to a person, are aware of the pain, unease, even anger some of you are experiencing. We’ve been briefed on the community sessions held to discuss the budget. The board chair also met with faculty at an in-person meeting last month, and we have received the petition from a group of College faculty, staff, and students that was delivered at the conclusion of this past Thursday’s assembly outside Old Chapel.\n\nTo all our community, we hear you, value you as foundational to this institution, and are committed to collaborating with you and our administrative leadership team as we move toward a balanced budget.\n\nBut our goal must be putting Middlebury on a solid fiscal footing. Our current financial situation is sufficiently challenging that we recently needed to borrow $45 million to finance our current operating deficits. We cannot do so again, and we must realize a structurally balanced budget. As painful as the current budget measures are, we are convinced that they are necessary—both to address our own long-term finances and to safeguard Middlebury’s future given the external attacks on higher education. Simply put, there are worse choices than those on the table today that could be even more harmful to our core mission. Our senior administrative leadership was careful to assemble a series of the “least-worst” options that will give us much-needed financial flexibility.\n\nWe therefore fully support the decisions the administration has made, consistent with our mandate to balance the budget and our long-term commitment to Middlebury’s financial health. We discussed our position with incoming president Ian Baucom throughout the board meetings this weekend. As you are aware, he has also endorsed the Senior Leadership Group’s plan in an earlier letter to the community.\n\nAs we look ahead, there are a number of key things to note. Once we achieve a balanced budget through structural reform, the board, Senior Leadership Group, and our incoming president uniformly agree that significantly addressing issues of faculty compensation must be among our very highest priorities—as well as other compensation issues that might arise or have arisen within our workforce. We also agree that we cannot wait to begin that work. For that reason, even as our financial challenges remain, we firmly support the administration’s proposal—strongly endorsed by Ian Baucom—to move forward this coming year with salary increases for faculty and staff at the College. After he assumes office in July, we will be working with President Baucom and the Senior Leadership Group to address a work plan for ongoing financial challenges across the institution.\n\nWith this difficult but essential work ahead of us, let’s please keep talking, keep looking for ways to incorporate viable new ideas throughout this process, and together keep striving to strengthen the Middlebury we all love.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTed Truscott ’83, Chair\n\nKaren Stolley ’77, Vice Chair\n\nLeilani Brown ’93, Vice Chair\n\nKirtley Cameron ’95, Vice Chair\n\nFor the Middlebury College Board of Trustees",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nWe write today to reaffirm the University’s commitment to the research enterprise as we navigate this extraordinarily challenging time. Last month, the federal government announced a freeze on more than $2 billion of grants and contracts that had been competitively awarded to Harvard researchers. Since last week, the University has received a large number of grant terminations from the federal government, stopping lifesaving research and, in some cases, losing years of important work.\n\n\n\nAlthough these actions were specifically targeted at Harvard, they are part of a broader campaign to revoke scientific research funding, which has included terminations of active awards at other institutions and a federal budget proposing steep cuts to National Institutes of Health funding and to National Science Foundation funding, among other measures. The impact of such steps on the nation’s scientific research enterprise could be severe and lasting. We will continue to fight the unlawful freeze and termination of our federal grants and to advocate for the productive partnership between the federal government and research universities that has for more than eighty years resulted in pathbreaking scientific discoveries, innovations, and advances in engineering, medicine, and public health.\n\n\n\nWe stand behind our thousands of outstanding faculty, postdoctoral, staff, and student researchers. Together they continue to make revolutionary discoveries, cure illness, deepen our understanding of the world, and translate that understanding into impact and invaluable teaching and mentorship that will produce the next generation of leading scientists and innovators. It is crucial for this country, the economy, and humankind that this work continue.\n\n\n\nThe University is working closely with our Schools to provide support to our research community. Although we cannot absorb the entire cost of the suspended or canceled federal funds, we will mobilize financial resources to support critical research activity for a transitional period as we continue to work with our researchers to identify alternative funding sources. For the coming year, the University will initially dedicate $250 million of central funding to complement School-based resources and strategies to support research affected by these recent suspensions and cancellations.\n\n\n\nDuring this period of significant financial constraint, leaders within our Schools will work with members of the research community to make informed, prudent decisions about how to adjust research programs in this changing funding environment. Academic leadership, faculty, staff, and researchers in the Schools are working together to find ways to support vital research while identifying necessary savings.\n\n\n\nWe are grateful to our community—and to our extraordinary researchers—for your resilience, creativity, and courage. We are also grateful to those who have made philanthropic contributions and supported our research enterprise in other ways in recent weeks. We understand the uncertainty that these times have brought and the burden our community faces. We are here to support you. While there will undoubtedly be difficult decisions and sacrifices ahead, we know that, together, we will chart a path forward to sustain and advance Harvard’s vital research mission.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nAlan M. Garber\n\nPresident\n\n\n\nJohn F. Manning\n\nProvost",

    "content": "We write to share a set of important policy updates related to travel by Brown community members.\n\nExtension of Freeze on Non-Essential Travel\n\nAs academic and administrative units across Brown continue to slow spending amid a budget deficit, and with continued uncertainty around potential financial impacts of federal government actions, we have extended the current freeze on non-essential travel through Sept. 1, 2025. As we noted in our March 13, 2025, message, “New measures to ensure financial sustainability,” travel is an area with significant unrestricted expenses across campus. The implementation of this temporary measure has been an important factor in reducing expenditures.\n\n“Essential travel” is that which is required to meet contractual obligations, necessary for core operations or research, or where no remote alternative is possible. Unit heads should approve only travel that is truly essential, and generally should not approve new non-essential travel unless it is already fully paid and non-refundable.\n\nWe know that this freeze has generated many questions from graduate students seeking to travel for conferences and research, and this March 25 message from Dean Thomas A. Lewis outlines examples of essential travel for PhD and MFA students. Master’s degree students should also follow the guidance provided in that letter, or email [email protected] with questions.\n\nPre-Registration Required for Reimbursement for Brown-Related International Travel\n\nEffective June 1, advance registration in Brown’s TravelSafe system will be required in order for Brown funds to be paid or reimbursed for Brown-related international travel. Registration in TravelSafe has consistently been required for any international travel by all individuals or groups traveling on Brown-related business or for Brown-related programs, in accordance with Brown’s Travel Policy. Going forward, a confirmation from TravelSafe must be attached to all reimbursement or funding requests. Registration for domestic travel is also strongly encouraged.\n\nBrown provides all students and employees registered with TravelSafe with access to International SOS, a global travel assistance program offering medical, security, and logistical support. Travelers are encouraged to download the ISOS app before their trip.\n\nHeads and managers of academic and administrative units may request “Department Manager” access in TravelSafe to stay informed about travel activity within their unit. This access, which is available through OIT’s Accounts and Passwords process, helps support planning, risk mitigation and policy compliance.\n\nRequirements for Travel to High-Risk Destinations for Brown-Related Business or Programs\n\nAs a reminder, all students traveling to destinations designated as “Brown High Risk Travel” must submit a Safety Plan to be reviewed by the Global Travel Risk Assessment Committee (GTRAC). Faculty and staff are strongly encouraged to submit a Safety Plan when traveling to high-risk areas to ensure preparedness and access to support.\n\nBrown defines high-risk travel destinations as those considered by the U.S. Department of State as a Travel Advisory Level 3 or Level 4, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Travel Health Notice Level 2 or Level 3, and/or those deemed as posing a significant health, safety or security risk to the traveler through advisories from International SOS.\n\nFor More Information\n\nAll Brown community members preparing for Brown-related travel are welcome to consult privately with the Office of Global Travel Operations, Risk & Resilience for pre-departure planning assistance, whether the travel is international or domestic.\n\nFor community members traveling internationally for Brown-related business or Brown-related programs, the University maintains a number of additional resources. Additional information is available on the Policies and Procedures page on the Office of Global Travel Operations, Risk & Resilience website, and the Office of Global Engagement’s Status Inquiry FAQs page.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III, Provost\n\nSarah Latham, Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration",

    "content": "Middlebury College has awarded Kellogg Fellowships to six students in support of senior research projects focused on the humanities. Fellows receive $5,000 for travel and research expenses over the summer and coming year.\n\n“The Kellogg fellowship is a vital source of support for Middlebury’s commitment to independent student research,” said Lisa Gates, associate dean for fellowships and research. “It’s always energizing and impressive to see such exciting and diverse topics that our students propose for their capstone work.”\n\nFollowing is a list of this year’s fellows with descriptions of their projects:\n\nCharlotte Roberts ’26, who is majoring in both gender, sexuality, and feminist studies and English, will work on a project titled “To Be At Risk: Telling the Colrain Story and Learning from a History of Resistance” focused on a wartime tax resistance action that occurred in Colrain, Massachusetts near where she grew up. The case received national attention after the IRS seized the home of a local couple, spurring an occupation of the property by peace activists for 18 months. Roberts plans to continue writing a book about the case started in 2016 by her grandparents. “Taking up the draft of ‘To Be at Risk’ from my grandparents to tell the story of the Colrain action is the perfect capstone experience to my undergraduate career,” writes Roberts. “It sits at the intersection of theory, creative writing, and social justice—topics in which I have been invested throughout my time at Middlebury.” She will be working on the project with advisor Spring Ulmer, visiting assistant professor of English.\n\nHannah Elefante ’26, who is majoring in history and Italian, will conduct research for a project titled “I Partigiani a Firenze: The Florentine Resistance in World War II.” The project will focus on how the resistance movement in Florence used propaganda, underground publications, and radio broadcasts to spread ideas, recruit new members, and challenge the Fascist regime. She is interested in two primary questions: how partisans in Florence engaged with local and national media to communicate their message during World War II; and to what extent the Florentine partisans’ relationship with the media changed between 1943 and 1945 during the German Occupation of Florence. “Engaging with these questions will direct me towards fascinating and intriguing primary sources that will reflect the changing relationship between the partisans and the media during World War II,” said Elefante, who will work with advisor Rebecca Bennette, professor of history.\n\nGreta Costello ’25, a history of art and museum studies major with a minor in French, will explore the moral imagery of the Dutch manuscript “The Hours of Catherine of Cleves” in conjunction with the “Egmont Breviary”—a prayer book created around the same time (1440) for Catherine of Cleves’s husband. She plans to use a comparative visual approach of the two illuminated manuscripts to gauge societal expectations of ‘pious’ women of the time. “I am looking forward to using the financial support of the Kellogg Fellowship as a way to access collections of medieval manuscript illuminations in Europe and the United States, and hopefully see one of the two manuscripts at the Morgan Library in New York,” she said. Costello will be working with advisor Eliza Garrison, professor of history of art and architecture.\n\nSajia Yaqouby ’25.5, a history of art major with a minor in gender, sexuality, and feminist studies, will work on a project titled “Visualizing Poetry: A Comparative Study of 19th-Century Kashmiri Manuscripts of Hafiz’s Divan.” She plans to conduct a comparative analysis of three Kashmiri copies of the Divan written by Hafiz—a 14th-century Persian poet—housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Walters Art Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution. “Through analyzing several similar manuscripts, I hope to gain insights into the aesthetics, advancements, and cultural exchanges that characterized 19th-century Kashmir,” writes Yaqouby. “My project will engage with broader questions of cultural transmission and adaptation.” Yaqouby will work with advisor Cynthia Packert, Christian A. Johnson Professor of History of Art.\n\nElliote Muir, ’26, an environmental studies major with a minor in Spanish, will use the award to continue working on a project titled “Carrying the Flag: Tracing the Modernization of the Explorers Club Through Adventures of Past and Present.” Her plan includes writing a book proposal on the evolution of the Explorers Club—an adventurer’s society dedicated to field research, scientific exploration, and resource conservation—by highlighting the work and life of a present-day explorer who embodies the club’s current values, while also tracing the club’s evolution over the past 120 years. “I am eager to talk to club officials and members to understand how this change has come around and where they hope it will go, and to incorporate these insights into my work,” said Muir, who will work with advisor Daniel Brayton, Julian W. Abernethy Professor of Literature.\n\nMadeleine Kaptein ’25.5, who is majoring in comparative literature with a minor in history of art, is working on a project titled “Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) and F.W Murnau’s Nosferatu (1922): Horror and Historical Anxieties in Innovative Art.” She will travel to England and Germany to conduct research based on historical archives, observational study of physical settings, and by visiting museums to better understand both works through historical, literary and visual analysis. “My project aims to dissect the core similarities and differences between the Vampire-centered Dracula text and the Nosferatu silent film; in particular I hope to identify details that embed them within the historical periods and locations in which they were created,” writes Kaptein, who will work with advisor Roman Graf, professor of German and comparative literature.\n\nThe Kellogg Fellowship is administered by Middlebury College through its Undergraduate Research office. A selection committee composed of the associate dean for fellowships and research and faculty members drawn from different disciplines reviews student applications and selects fellows each spring.

    "content": "Dear Pomona College Community,\n\n\n\nOn this beautiful May day here on our spectacular campus, I want to begin this summary of a productive semester by celebrating our graduating class of 2025. Close to 450 graduates, 447 to be exact, will receive their Pomona degrees this Sunday. They have earned their degrees through extraordinary hard work and a vision for themselves that will make them vital contributors to our world across their lives. All of us in the faculty and staff are justifiably proud of our graduates. We look forward to seeing them walk out our College Gates and cheering them on during Commencement this Sunday to cap off a weekend of celebrations together with the families and friends that have stood with them as they reached this pivotal achievement. It is going to be a wonderful weekend, and we thank everyone who is working so hard to provide our graduates and all those around them with a ceremony to treasure.\n\nAs my role as acting president also nears its end, I look forward both to passing the baton back to President Starr on July 1, and to relishing this special time ahead on campus with you. I am particularly grateful for all of the support and kindness you have shown me across this semester. It is truly a privilege to serve this College community.\n\nThe number of prestigious scholarships and fellowships our students have earned this year is another reminder of the quality of our students and of a Pomona education. This year we have our first Rhodes Scholar in 20 years, along with 15 Fulbright recipients, bringing the College’s total number of Fulbright Scholars across its history to 315. This year, our students also earned a Luce Fellowship, two Gilman Scholarships, and Pomona’s first Watson Fellowship since 2022.\n\nOur faculty never cease to amaze us with their accomplishments. Professor Lupe Bacio will continue her research on the impact of COVID-19 on Latino Caregivers thanks to the support of a Haynes Foundation grant, while Professor Prageeta Sharma was awarded a Creative Writing Fellowship through the National Endowment for the Arts. And this past month, we received the incredible news that Professor Jonathan Lethem was recognized with a Guggenheim Fellowship in fiction. Congratulations to all!\n\nFulfilling Our Promise to Students of All Backgrounds\n\nWe are also proud to continue providing access to a Pomona education for students regardless of their financial circumstances. For example, 23 percent of the students in our current first-year class are first-generation students, and 19 percent are Pell-eligible.\n\nTo help support access for talented students, our alumni and families have given generously time and time again. For example, last fall alumnus David Sklar '83 and his wife, Susan Acevedo, gave $1 million for scholarship support. Given in honor of their parents, the gift will expand college access for low-income California students who plan to pursue studies in STEM at Pomona. Our deepest thanks to our alumni and other donors for the support that makes possible this investment in our students and their futures.\n\nPomona continues to be an institution of choice for outstanding students of every background, and an institution with a growing global footprint. The admitted students in the Class of 2029 alone represent 48 states and 45 countries. Like all classes in recent years, that class will see more than half of its members study abroad before they graduate. And our faculty keep building on the successful launch of our Global Gateway programs, including professors Nina Karnovsky and Wallace Meyer taking students this spring to Hawaii to study the conservation of biodiversity, with support from Robert D. ’68 and Diane Piety and from a research fund established by alumni Benjamin Godsey ’95 and Yvonne Chan ’95. Likewise, we look forward to this summer’s program to Mexico City led by economics professors Fernando Lozano and Karla Cordova, which will be supported by a gift from Pomona parents David and Leslie Burgstahler P’22.\n\nTo underscore how significant Pomona’s commitment to a global education is, let me point out that less than 10 percent of U.S. college graduates have studied outside this country during college. A Pomona education gives our students a powerful edge in understanding the world and a global perspective on its grand challenges.\n\nSupport from our entire Sagehen community enriches the Pomona faculty and student experience in countless ways. In fact, we are about to close our second consecutive record-breaking year of fundraising in support of the College’s mission. While we look forward to sharing more details after July 1, we are incredibly grateful to have a community that believes in–and steps up to drive–the incredible promise of Pomona.\n\nFaculty Hiring and Accreditation Review\n\nThe excellence and quality of our faculty continue to grow. This year, we invested in a record number of searches for a single academic year, resulting in the hiring of 15 new teacher-scholars. With departures and the retirements of several outstanding colleagues, this set of successful hires increases our continuing faculty by nine, further strengthening the personalized learning and low student-faculty ratio that are essential to a Pomona education. We offer all the faculty and staff involved in the exceptional work of the search committees our gratitude and thanks.\n\nThis spring also featured an important special visit from our accrediting body, the Western Association of Colleges and Schools–Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). This visit was an opportunity to update the Commission on Pomona’s progress in several key areas and produced important discussions within the College and with a knowledgeable group of external reviewers. The time and effort faculty and academic administrators gave to this review made it both productive and meaningful.\n\nCommunity Care and Engagement\n\nSagehens also care for the community. We certainly saw that in the aftermath of last winter’s horrific Los Angeles wildfires. When five of our employee families tragically lost their homes in the fires, I was so impressed with the way our staff and faculty sprang into action. The College was able to help provide temporary housing for some of the families. Staff Council organized a donation drive to provide for fire victims’ immediate needs, and so many contributions came in that there was plenty left over to help other organizations in their fire relief efforts as well.\n\nMeanwhile, during this year’s spring break, three groups of students also dedicated their time to serving others. Through the Draper Center’s Alternabreak program, our students served the communities of Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco, where they embarked on projects related to housing and food insecurity.\n\nThis spring our students, acting on their own initiative, also got involved in the local community in other ways. During the summer, a sophomore politics major, Josh Crowley, came up with the idea for Sagehen Civic Scholars—Pomona students who would intern with the City of Claremont. He met with the Claremont city manager and in five minutes got him on board with the idea. The deputy city manager then worked with city departments to develop internship opportunities with real impact. More than 70 students applied for the nine intern spots, and next fall the city hopes to offer additional positions. Besides getting students involved and interested in local government, these opportunities strengthen our strong relationship with Claremont. Well done, Josh.\n\nStrategic Vision Progress\n\nWe are also deeply committed to encouraging and respecting diversity, work that we know continues to require our best efforts. Because we know we are stronger when everyone’s voice is included, we have a responsibility to make sure that our campus climate is welcoming to all. Through the Bridge the Gap program, our students engaged in meaningful conversations and dialogue with students from Biola University this semester. In addition, this year’s monthly Year of Dialogue events for students, staff and faculty have been a meaningful contribution to this effort, and we appreciate all those who have participated.\n\nFor 138 years, Pomona College has been a place of excellence. It continues to be so because of each one of you. Our dedicated faculty and our outstanding staff commit themselves every day to challenging and supporting our students, our students continue to inspire us with their hard work and passion for impact, and our alumni, families and friends continue to trust and support the college and its people, a faith that humbles us as much as it motivates us. As this academic year nears its close, I thank you for all you mean to Pomona and its future–and look forward to being with you as we celebrate a new class of graduates that represent the best of our great College’s mission.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines\n\nActing President\n\nEdwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "Dean Osofsky is Stepping Down\n\nDear Northwestern Community,\n\nEarlier today, Northwestern Pritzker School of Law Dean Hari Osofsky announced she will step down from her role as dean this summer to lead important new initiatives at Northwestern — addressing challenges related to her deep and long-term interests in the rule of law, energy and climate change. We appreciate her leadership on these exciting University initiatives integral to our strategic priorities and look forward to working with her on them.\n\nWe are grateful for Dean Osofsky’s dedication to the Law School and to Northwestern, and for her impactful leadership contributions over the past four years. Since joining Northwestern in 2021, Dean Osofsky achieved notable successes, including hiring nearly one-quarter of the research faculty at the Law School, significantly improving student employment outcomes and recruiting the most selective class in the Law School’s 165-year history each year she was dean. Her impressive fundraising totaled almost $50 million, including three new endowed chairs, significant expansion of student scholarships and major gifts supporting the Bluhm Legal Clinic.\n\nUnder Dean Osofsky’s leadership, the Law School launched numerous new programs and centers, including the West Coast Initiative, Center for Racial and Disability Justice, Knox Conversations speaker series, Bluhm Legal Clinic’s LGBTQI+ Rights Clinic, Rivkin Law and Public Advocacy Fellows Program, and Writing Lab. The Law School also re-entered the top 10 in the U.S. News & World Report rankings, was the No. 1 “Go-To Law School for Big Law” in the country for two consecutive years and was ranked No. 7 in the nation for its return on investment of a law degree.\n\nIn her new role, she will direct the Energy Innovation Lab and the Rule of Law Global Academic Partnership, both vital initiatives that will have an impact on Northwestern and beyond. Our new Energy Innovation Lab will advance cutting-edge interdisciplinary research on energy innovation in partnership with bi-partisan business, government and non-profit leaders. Since Dean Osofsky launched the non-partisan Rule of Law Global Academic Partnership earlier this spring, it has already grown to more than 150 law schools from six continents. I look forward to the critically needed research, teaching, programming and public education it will develop.\n\nThe University will announce an interim dean in the coming weeks. Please join me in thanking Dean Osofsky for her leadership both at the Law School and as she takes on these key roles for the University.",

    "content": "Welcome to Columbia on this momentous occasion, this celebration of our 271st academic year.\n\nTo our nearly 16,000 soon-to-be graduates, are you ready to get your degrees?\n\nBefore I share very brief thoughts with you, given the rain; I want to say a few words to the parents, families, and loved ones here today.\n\nOne of our most beloved graduates and faculty members, was philosopher and poet Irwin Edman, who helped to create the Core Curriculum. He wrote eloquently about something we are all experiencing today.\n\nWhat it feels like to take satisfaction and pride in the accomplishments of children other than one’s own.\n\n“Other people’s children,” he wrote, “are born at about sixteen or seventeen years old. One learns to enjoy them for the promise and charm and hope they embody. And to further as best one can, while they are still within one’s orbit, what is best in them.”\n\nParents and families. We have not known them as long as you have. But we have had the privilege of meeting your young stars in our classrooms, eager to explore new interests and ideas, brilliant and accomplished.\n\nOur spectacular faculty have undeniably furthered what is best within them.\n\nTheir idealism. Their curiosity. Their ability to ask the right questions. And their ability to answer them—to their benefit, and to the world’s.\n\nFamilies, you have given us a gift. Thank you. Graduates, it is time to give the world your gifts.\n\nSo with that, let me turn to you, the nearly 16,000 graduates of the Columbia University class of 2025. You are the best of us.\n\nOur youngest graduate turned 20 this week. Our oldest was born in 1948. More than 125 of you served the United States in uniform, thank you. You hail from all 50 of the United States – plus DC and Puerto Rico.\n\nMore than 6,800 of you represent 141 countries outside the United States. And let me say – we are glad you chose to be here. We need you. We draw strength from our identity as a global institution. And we firmly believe that our international students have the same rights to freedom of speech as everyone else, and should not be targeted by the government for exercising that right. And let me also say that I know many in our community today are mourning the absence of our graduate, Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nYou are lawyers and linguists, philosophers and physicians. Masters of business and fine arts and public health. You’ve been named Marshall Scholars, Fulbright Scholars, and Truman Scholars—won National Science Foundation awards.\n\nYou’ve been crowned champions on the field of play—from women’s basketball to men’s and women’s fencing, to tennis, to an Ivy League Championship in football. (There was a time in my life where you’d get laughed at if you said; Columbia, strong sports school. You’ve already made history.)\n\nSome of you are well on your professional paths, and some just beginning to see the shape your path may take.\n\nThat’s who you are. And you’re something else, as well.\n\nYou’re exactly what the world needs at this moment. Not simply because you happen to be graduates of the greatest institution in the world. That helps, of course.\n\nBut also, because the most resilient, visionary, innovative leaders are forged in times of challenge and change, and you have already navigated your way through considerable turbulence.\n\nI want to offer one observation, given the rain, to keep in mind as you step out into this world, which is this.",

Those values will be on full display this week.\n\nCongratulations to the Class of 2025!

    "content": "Dear Members of the Brown Community,\n\nAs we prepare for Commencement, we are writing to reinforce community standards for respect for others and to share tips and guidance to help ensure that all students and families have equal opportunities to mark this important milestone.\n\nBrown is a community whose members value engaging in various forms of expression as a powerful means of advocacy and support. We therefore continue to ensure that there is a shared understanding among all who will participate in this momentous weekend that expression is permissible, but becomes unacceptable when it compromises the safety and security of others, or interferes in the rights of others to engage in the activities or operations of the University.\n\nWe are sharing this message with our full community of students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents, families and friends who will be on campus for Brown’s Commencement and Reunion activities. This is a time for community and celebration as the events bring tens of thousands of people to campus to experience the joys and traditions of graduation, reflect on great memories and make new ones.\n\nThe following guidance and tips apply to all participants and guests:\n\nGraduates and guests are not permitted to bring items to Commencement or Reunion events that would obstruct the view or create a safety hazard for others (e.g., large banners, posters, rigid sticks or poles, etc.), and also cannot affix signage, banners or similar displays to any buildings, poles or other structures.\n\nStudents who choose to adorn their caps and/or gowns with images and/or messages, and alumni and friends who choose to decorate or design their apparel, may do so provided that the content does not violate the University’s codes of conduct and does not discriminate against or harass individuals or groups based on an actual or perceived membership in a protected class.\n\nSignage, flags and other forms of expression may be on display, provided that they meet the same nondiscrimination and anti-harassment standards noted above.\n\nCrowd noise must not interfere with the ability of everyone to enjoy the ceremonies. The weekend is a celebration, and we know that all participants and guests will want to appreciate the graduates, but it’s important that all in attendance also be able to listen to instructions from Brown’s event staff and volunteers who are working very hard to make the weekend a success for all.\n\nStaff from offices and departments across campus will dedicate significant time in the days ahead to attend to every detail to make Commencement and Reunion weekend possible for the thousands who attend. We want to thank you in advance for all that you will do to cooperate with them.\n\nBrown is known as a community that can have difficult but necessary conversations while demonstrating respect and value for others. We are proud that we are an academic community committed to respecting the views, perspectives and experiences of others, even when individuals disagree. This reflects our core values as a teaching and learning institution.\n\nWe hope you will participate in the celebratory events this weekend, and in doing so, that you help ensure that the focus remains on the tremendous accomplishments of our graduating students. This is a once-in-a-lifetime event for them. You can learn more about Commencement weekend, including the schedule for all planned events, by visiting https://commencement.brown.edu/.\n\nWe extend our congratulations to our 2025 graduates and their families, while we also recognize the many faculty, staff and student peers who supported our graduates in their journeys to reach this momentous milestone. We hope you share our excitement in joining together as a community in a festive and joyous celebration this weekend.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III\n\nProvost\n\nRussell C.

    "content": "We write to share details on two new initiatives created to provide support for international members of our community. Whether navigating complex visa processes or preparing for essential travel abroad, we know that international students, staff and faculty are facing difficult questions and concerns amid shifting federal policies. Brown’s new support resources aim to provide timely, practical assistance during moments of challenge or uncertainty.\n\nInternational Faculty and Staff Emergency Fund\n\nThe University has established a new International Faculty and Staff Emergency Fund intended to assist eligible employees as they manage legal or personal expenses resulting from unexpected, unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances connected to their visa status. Such circumstances might include a sudden visa termination or other unanticipated disruption. This program offers up to $2,000 in one-time emergency funding as part of the University’s commitment to offer community members support during moments of urgent need — it is not intended to cover routine immigration-related expenses, such as standard visa renewals or elective travel.\n\nEligibility and Details\n\nThose eligible to apply for this assistance are non-U.S. citizen, non-student Brown employees — including faculty, staff and postdoctoral employees — who are in benefits-eligible full- or part-time positions and have a current annual salary of $100,000 or less.\n\nEligible employees may apply for up to $2,000 in taxable funds. These are not loans and do not need to be repaid.\n\nThere may be limitations in Brown’s capacity to dispense funds based on visa sponsorship arrangements. For example, employees who have a visa sponsored by another institution may require written approval from that sponsor.\n\nEligible employees may request one-time support by submitting a confidential application. These will be reviewed on a rolling basis by the Office of the Provost (for faculty and postdoctoral scholars) or by University Human Resources (for staff).\n\nApproved funding will be provided in the employee’s next available paycheck.\n\nThe program will remain open to applications through Dec. 12, 2025.\n\nOngoing Student Support\n\nWhile eligibility for the faculty and staff emergency fund is limited to non-student employees, Brown offers several parallel mechanisms for students experiencing a range of financial challenges, including immigration-related hardship:\n\nUndergraduates seeking support for emergent immigration-related financial needs are encouraged to schedule a financial advising appointment with the International Advising team in the College and also can continue to seek appointments on a range of hardship needs, including for immigration, with the Financial Advising team.\n\nUndergraduates and graduate students may apply for emergency funding through the E-Gap program.\n\nGraduate students may also be eligible for the Assistance Fund for International Students in UFunds, which provides up to $500 for visa-related legal or administrative expenses.\n\nLegal Assistance for Non-U.S. Citizens Traveling Internationally for Brown-Related Purposes\n\nThrough a new partnership with immigration law firm Green and Spiegel, Brown is facilitating legal assistance for non-U.S. citizen students, faculty and staff who:\n\nhave been approved by their department chair or supervisor for essential, Brown-related, international travel, and\n\nhave completed a legal referral form.\n\nAvailable legal support may include:\n\nA pre-travel consultation with an attorney to address general immigration questions and assess risks.\n\nEnrollment in an attorney accessibility program, which allows Green and Spiegel to act on a traveler's behalf and work toward a resolution if challenges arise during re-entry into the U.S.\n\nAs a reminder, all Brown students and employees (including staff, faculty and postdocs) are required to register international, Brown-related travel in TravelSafe in accordance with Brown’s Travel Policy. As of May 16, 2025, pre-registration is required for reimbursement for international travel for Brown-related business or Brown-related programs.\n\nAdditional details are available on the University Human Resources website, and community members can email [email protected] with questions. The new legal support services will remain available through Sept. 1, 2025, at which point the University will evaluate the program.\n\nAdditional Resources and Support for International Travel\n\nIn addition to the legal assistance available through the Green and Spiegel immigration law firm:\n\nAll Brown travelers are welcome to consult privately with the Office of Global Travel Operations, Risk and Resilience for pre-departure planning assistance.\n\nBrown provides all registered students and employees with access to International SOS, a global travel assistance program offering medical, security and logistical support.\n\nMore information on international travel is available on the Office of Global Engagement’s Status Inquiry FAQs page.\n\nThe new emergency financial support and legal resources reflect Brown’s commitment to supporting the safety and well-being of our international students, faculty and staff. We encourage eligible students, faculty and staff to make use of these resources and to reach out with any questions about accessing assistance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III, Provost\n\nSarah Latham, Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration",

Larry Jameson’s Remarks for the University of Pennsylvania's 269th Commencement Ceremony Adapt Creatively.\n\nBy J. Larry Jameson, MD, PhD\n\nMay 19, 2025\n\nThank you, Reverend Howard.\n\nTo our national anthem singer, Carlee Reid: that was inspiring, and “pitch perfect!”\n\nOf course, the expert would be our Commencement Speaker, Elizabeth Banks, but more about this later...\n\nToday, Franklin Field is filled with joy thanks to the support and pride of our families and friends. Let’s hear it for them!\n\nAnd, from the audience, let’s hear it for our graduates!\n\nYour Class is historic for many reasons. For example, you have done something that only two classes in our entire history can claim. You are graduating in the same year that the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl. Go Birds.\n\nYou have other claims to history, too.\n\nMany of you finished high school and started college during the pandemic. You persisted with graduate and professional studies through the twists and turns of COVID.\n\nYou have persevered and advanced in a world that is only changing faster – where, ironically, the word “unprecedented” is something we hear all the time.\n\nWhen the ground under our feet is shifting, how do we find our footing?\n\nHere is one example. Earlier this year, parts of Los Angeles were ravaged by wildfire.\n\nMany people – perhaps some here today – fled, lost their homes, or even loved ones. Firefighters from across the country came to help. LA neighbors rallied in support.\n\nNot long after, I was in this area visiting alumni and Penn families. As you would expect, the conversation often turned to the fires and the methods for putting them out – including a technique called backburning, or fighting fire with fire.\n\nThis approach seems counterintuitive. But, the fire consumes available fuel – brush and oxygen – which can help slow the destruction. In this kind of crisis, firefighters need courage, cool heads, and – most important – they must adapt to succeed.\n\nAcross Spruce Street, at our medical school, you will find other examples of creativity and adaptation.\n\nDr. Carl June’s CAR-T cell breakthroughs are the whitecoat equivalent of fighting fire with fire. This novel approach unleashes engineered immune cells against cancer.\n\nDespite decades of naysayers, Nobel Prize winners Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman developed modified mRNA as a new form of treatment. This technology helped end the COVID pandemic in record time, saved countless lives, and will revolutionize health care as we know it.\n\nThis is why we must continue to invest in research. Penn could not be more proud or more committed to these revolutionary advances, and the pioneering work happening in all of our Schools every day.\n\nFrom wildfires to wild innovations, the lessons are clear: In volatile times – when the pressure is on, the odds are long, and the stakes are high – adapting creatively can make a huge difference.\n\nYou are well prepared for this. Your professors, peers, coaches, and communities have been helping you hone your skills.\n\nWatching you adapt in real time, I have observed 3 essential characteristics, all Ben Franklin traits that are memorialized in our values – and inscribed in our sidewalks!\n\nThey are: Curiosity, Creativity, and Self-Improvement.\n\nFirst, Curiosity. The drive to test new ideas, try new passions, triumph and stumble, and seek new friends. The boldness to try fresh adventures, even though they make you feel uncomfortable. The curiosity that secured a 2025 Rhodes Scholarship for your classmate, Ohm Gandhi. Keep feeding your curiosity. No matter how fast the world advances, you will be open and ready to seize opportunity.\n\nNext, Creativity. As you have grown at Penn, you have proven adept at novel thinking. You kickstarted businesses, created art and contributed to culture, leveraged AI, conducted original research, and excelled in patient care and service to our community. The winners of the President’s Engagement Prizes, Innovation Prizes, and Draw Down the Lightning grants are just a few examples of your creativity. Never stop creating or undergoing your own reinvention.\n\nLastly, Self-Improvement. Each of us and everything we do will be, to some extent, imperfect – with one exception: this year’s flawless season for our men’s squash team. And, let’s not forget the incredible performance of our women’s lacrosse team – for the second straight year, they advanced to the NCAA quarterfinals.\n\nIn already uncertain times, our flaws and failures can spark anxiety. That fear can hold us back. But the point is not perfection; it is that we always strive to be better.\n\nCuriosity, Creativity, and Self-Improvement: These are Penn values. They are your values.\n\nUse them often, keep them sharp, and they will serve you well.\n\nIt is by adapting that you will help to shape the future.\n\nGraduates, we are so proud of what you have accomplished. We will be even more proud of what you go on to achieve. As you join hundreds of thousands of Penn alumni, keep your Penn memories close, your Penn friends even closer, and know that this University will always be yours.\n\nThank you all. Congratulations to the terrific Class of 2025!",

Recipients receive up to three years of financial support and are selected based on their demonstration of independence of thought, purposeful leadership, and a civic mindset.\n\n“My career is driven by the reality that half of the world’s population doesn’t have access to healthcare, and chronic diseases like cancer lack effective treatments and disproportionately affect under-resourced communities,” writes Nguyen, who is from Di Linh, Vietnam. “I aspire to become a physician-scientist who bridges clinical care, translational research, and entrepreneurship to tackle this issue.”\n\nKnight-Hennessey credits Nguyen with contributing to the advancement of the understanding of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases through research at Middlebury College, Rockefeller University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Cambridge, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. As a Social Entrepreneurship Fellow at Middlebury, Nguyen collaborated with the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the World Telehealth Initiative to establish Kenya’s first telemedicine system.\n\nAnnounced in 2016, Knight-Hennessy Scholars is named after Phil Knight, philanthropist and cofounder of Nike Inc., and John Hennessy, chairman of Alphabet Inc. and president emeritus of Stanford (2000-2016). Knight-Hennessy Scholars is the largest, university-wide, fully endowed graduate fellowship in the world. Learn more at kh.stanford.edu.",

    "content": "The Middlebury Board of Trustees at its May 10 annual meeting approved a fiscal year 2026 budget with revenues of $335.3 million and expenses of $344 million. The board also amended the core retirement plan, received an update on For Every Future: The Campaign for Middlebury, and approved tenure recommendations.\n\nDavid Provost, executive vice president for finance and administration, said budgeted fiscal year 2026 expenses will increase by $6 million over 2025 projected expenses due to higher health insurance costs, salary increases, new residence hall depreciation and interest, an increase in the borrowing costs of new operating debt, and other inflationary adjustments. Overall, the approved fiscal year 2026 budget assumes an $8.6 million deficit.\n\nMotions Passed\n\nBoard Chair William F. “Ted” Truscott ’83 notified the board that in April the Prudential Committee authorized Middlebury to borrow up to $45 million to provide working capital to fund operations. The loan was secured at 4.66 percent and will be paid back over 10 years.\n\nDuring the annual meeting on Saturday, the board passed a resolution amending the College’s core retirement plan, reducing the nonelective contribution for participants who are 45 years old and hired before July 3, 2017, from 15 percent to 11 percent, effective for payroll periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026.\n\nIn addition to the operating budget, trustees also approved a fiscal year 2026 capital budget of $28.6 million with $18 million in funding from 2025 bonds and $10.6 million from positive cash flow depreciation. The funds will be used to pay ongoing construction of the new residence hall; renovation of Stewart Hall and Armstrong Library, and upgrades to IT and facilities; building space changes over the summer; and other capital expenditures.\n\nReaffirmation of Institutional Autonomy and Board Independence\n\nTruscott notified the board that he had signed a letter from the Association of Governing Boards (AGB) titled “Reaffirming the Independence of Higher Education Governance: A Call to Action.” Later in the day, the full board passed a resolution recommended by the AGB. It reaffirms the trustees’ commitment to institutional autonomy and board independence, including the following:\n\nAn unwavering commitment to maintaining the independence of the institution’s governance.\n\nA pledge that all decisions will continue to be made in the best interests of Middlebury’s educational mission, students, faculty, staff, and public service, free from external political pressures.\n\nA call for all stakeholders—policymakers, higher education leaders, and the public—to defend the autonomy of America’s colleges and universities as essential to a thriving democracy and economy.\n\nAuthorization of the chair and president of the Board of Trustees to communicate this commitment publicly and to advocate for policies that protect board independence and institutional autonomy.\n\nPresident’s Report\n\nInterim President Stephen Snyder thanked the board, senior leadership, faculty, staff, and students for their support during his tenure, which ends June 30, 2025. He said his time as president allowed him to experience the “brilliant teaching, learning, research, and community life that characterize every aspect of Middlebury College, the Institute, and Schools.” Snyder listed a number of events he attended that he described as “intellectually impressive, artistically dazzling, and ethically inspiring events and people.” Among them were lectures and discussions that represented diverse opinions, but that were respectful, inclusive of a range of opinions and deep differences, and “in which students, faculty, and staff were able to come together to better understand one another.”\n\nAdmissions Update\n\nNicole Curvin, vice president for strategic enrollment and dean of admissions, updated trustees on the College Class of 2029 and 2029.5, which included a combined total of 11,831 applications. Acceptances were sent to 13.9 percent of the applicant pool. In March, 1,136 students were admitted through the Regular Decision round, joining 519 students admitted through the Early Decision 1 and Early Decision 2 rounds. Throughout the month of April, Admissions welcomed hundreds of admitted students and their families for Preview Days that included visits to classes and dining halls, tours, and special programming.\n\nCurvin shared some of the following highlights of the Class of 2029 and 2029.5 admitted students:\n\n1,112 high schools represented from around the world\n\n95 languages spoken\n\n73 countries represented\n\n49 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico represented\n\n18 percent first generation\n\n$19.7 million in financial aid\n\nTenure Promotions\n\nThe board approved tenure recommendations for the following eight members of the College faculty, effective July 1:\n\nSamuel Byrne, Biology, Global Health\n\nKirsten Coe, Biology\n\nMichelle Leftheris, Studio Art\n\nAlex Lyford, Mathematics and Statistics\n\nGregory Pask, Biology\n\nLana Povitz, History\n\nAndrea Vaccari, Computer Science\n\nErin Wolcott, Economics\n\nCampaign Update\n\nDan Courcey, vice president for Advancement, gave an update on For Every Future: The Campaign for Middlebury—the largest, most comprehensive of its kind in Middlebury history. To date, Middlebury has raised $86 million in new commitments during the current fiscal year, bringing our overall campaign total to $543 million.\n\nOn Saturday, May 10, trustee Parker Harris ’89, P ’20 made a surprise announcement that he and his spouse, Holly Johnson ’87, P ’20, will be giving a $15 million campaign gift. Motivated by the vision of incoming president Ian Baucom, Harris said this commitment will be allocated in the following ways:\n\n$8 million to endow and underwrite midd.data and provide support to professors\n\n$5 million in endowed funding for pedagogical innovation related to AI and other emerging technologies\n\n$2 million in support of the proposed art museum\n\nHarris, who is chief technology officer of Slack and cofounder of Salesforce, is also co-chair of the For Every Future campaign. He and his family previously gave $7 million for endowed financial aid and to bolster the midd.data program.\n\nOverall, the campaign moved closer to its goal of engaging 85 percent of alumni by having 78 percent of graduates attend an event, volunteer, communicate with Middlebury, or make a gift.\n\nProgress toward meeting the pillars of the campaign is as follows:\n\nAccess and financial aid: 76 percent of $215 million goal\n\npercent of $215 million goal Academic excellence: 90 percent of $120 million goal\n\nExperiential learning: 79 percent of $70.5 million goal\n\nBoard Elections and Appointments\n\nThe trustees elected the following officers for the 2025–2026 fiscal year: William F. Truscott (chair); Leilani Brown ’93 (vice chair); Kirtley H. Cameron ’95 (vice chair); Ian Baucom (president); Hannah S. Ross (secretary); Susan Parsons Ritter ’83 (associate secretary); Charlene M. Barrett (assistant secretary); David J. Provost (treasurer); and Alberto Citarella (assistant treasurer).\n\nOther elected positions included Koby Altman ’04, who was elected to serve as a term trustee (he previously served a five-year term as an alumni trustee); Janine Hetherington ’95 (alumni trustee); Alexander “Alex” J. Finkelstein ’97 (term trustee); Patrick M. Dorton ’90 (term trustee); and Xi-An “Andrew” Li ’99 (term trustee).\n\nTrustees elected the following new partner advisors: Suhail Shaikh (College Board of Advisors), Jed A. Smith ’88 (College Board of Advisors), Keith R. Nilsson P’25 (Institute Board of Advisors), Henry “Tyler” Nottberg ’98 (Institute Board of Advisors), and Joel A.

    "content": "Commencement Remarks for the Class of 2025\n\nPresident Kathleen Harring delivers remarks to the Muhlenberg College Class of 2025.\n\nSunday, May 18, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nFamilies, friends, faculty, staff, trustees, and distinguished guests — thank you for joining us today to honor our graduates.\n\nMuhlenberg Class of 2025, congratulations! We are so proud of your remarkable achievements.\n\nToday, I want to reflect on three things: everything you've done, everything you will do, and how you will change the world.\n\nBut first, a word from one of our sponsors, the liberal arts:\n\nThe liberal arts are perhaps the most American form of education. Liberal arts colleges arose directly from the American Enlightenment and its ideals, the same intellectual movement that gave us the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and other writings that inform the foundation of our country. From the American Enlightenment, the liberal arts gets its emphasis on reason, individual rights, the cultivation of well-rounded individuals capable of critical thinking, effective communication, and civic responsibility.\n\nThe liberal arts also are full of paradoxes. Whatever you majored in, there’s a good chance that your career won’t focus on that specific discipline. There often is not a straight path from your major to your profession. And that’s not a weakness, it’s a strength. Don’t get me wrong; what you study is important, but at Muhlenberg we’ve seen countless alumni thrive in careers far removed from their majors. In fact, many of you will work in fields that don't even exist right now. This is important. To lead today, you need a skillset that demands flexibility, transcends disciplines, and focuses on what connects them.\n\nThat brings me to what you’ve done. While at Muhlenberg you experienced extraordinary events, from the rise of artificial intelligence to massive geopolitical shifts. In the midst of all that, you have mastered complex topics. Interned at hundreds of companies and nonprofits. Conducted ground-breaking research. Studied away from campus. Created astonishing works of art, drama, and music. Won conference championships. Led student organizations for the betterment of the college community — and so much more.\n\nYou’ve been getting all the benefits of our rigorous academic programs, PLUS the intangibles of attending a place like Muhlenberg. You’ve become more well-rounded individuals who think critically about difficult topics. You know how to communicate effectively. You have learned how to reason methodically and ethically. You know that being a responsible citizen is a duty, not an option. Think of these intangibles as sparks that result from friction — friction that comes from living in close community with one another and, also, from competing ideas and competing priorities all jostling together.\n\nOn to what you will do: You will succeed, and you will succeed greatly. You will thrive in this environment, just like you have thrived here at Muhlenberg. But not only will you thrive, you will lead. You have the ability to delve deeply, master complex topics, and engage with those who think differently than you do. You also understand how to do that ethically and humanely. This is one of the reasons our graduates are more successful than most; they are prepared to lead and serve.\n\nFinally, how you will change the world: You will do it by applying all you have learned — from the tangible things you have created to the intangibles that come from relationships and experiences — and you will apply it to solve the world’s thorniest problems. Problems that are complex, that seem intractable, that require a multidisciplinary approach. You will solve those wicked problems. And by doing that you will help advance the common good. This is what leadership looks like.\n\nWhy is this important? This kind of leadership is critical to economic vitality and a healthy democracy. The American Enlightenment thinkers understood that democracy and vitality depend on well-educated citizens. Indeed, James Madison wrote: “The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.”\n\nIn its most successful form, our democracy inspires free citizens, who while pursuing their own ends, act together in service to the common good. I would posit that the collective efforts of free people are some of the most powerful forces on earth.\n\nFrederick A. Muhlenberg, our College’s first president, led the college with two purposes in mind: the education of the conscience and the cultivation of the heart. Our brand of liberal arts education is an expression of American democracy’s best parts. We are, each of us, empowered to pursue our own ends, and that is good. A liberal arts education requires us to work together. Democracy requires us to work together. And that is good. When we do that in a principled and ethical way — when we lead with our minds and our hearts — we better the world.\n\nSo, this is my charge to you:\n\nTake your Muhlenberg experience out into the world. Ask questions. Act ethically.\n\nSolve those wicked problems.\n\nLead with your mind and your heart. Be successful and advance the common good.\n\nLike the liberal arts, democracy is a contact sport. So make contact. Cause friction. Generate sparks.\n\nBe the Mules our world desperately needs.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2025. I look forward to welcoming you back to your Muhlenberg home and celebrating all your accomplishments. Now, go and change the world!",

I have joined with more than 200 college and university presidents and leaders of scholarly societies to release a statement titled, “A Call for Constructive Engagement.” This statement succinctly elucidates guiding values and principles of US higher education to which Sarah Lawrence subscribes that are being challenged by ongoing actions of the federal government; I encourage you to read it in full, sharing here this key excerpt:\n\n“...colleges and universities share a commitment to serve as centers of open inquiry where, in their pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation.”\n\nWe remain fully committed to living the values and upholding the principles I have articulated in recent issues of “From the President’s Desk” that are reflected in this collective presidential statement.\n\nAnd as we do this critical work we will also continue to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments that define and enrich our community. Importantly, in these last weeks of our semester, great work is on display daily throughout the campus. In less than three weeks we celebrate the culmination of the academic year with Commencement! I am delighted to share that visionary fashion icon and proud Sarah Lawrence alumnus Sam Edelman '73 will deliver the keynote address at our 97th Commencement ceremony on Friday, May 9.\n\nI’m also thrilled to announce that the Board of Trustees has voted unanimously to confer an honorary degree – Doctor of Arts, honoris causa – upon Lucinda Childs ‘62, the pioneering choreographer and performer whose work has immensely influenced the dance field for more than half a century.\n\nLast but certainly not least, in a Commencement Week tradition, Art History faculty member and former Dean of the College Jerrilynn Dodds will deliver the Senior Lecture. A revered and much-loved member of the faculty since 2009, I know Jerri will bring her signature wit and intellect to the lecture, which always bears the theme, “A Life of Learning”.\n\nIn the midst of challenging times, occasions like Commencement remind us why our work matters. It is a moment to celebrate the potential of our students as they step into a world that needs them more than ever.\n\nYours,\n\nCristle Collins Judd\n\nPresident\n\npresident@sarahlawrence.edu\n\nInstagram: @slcprez",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Sarah Lawrence Community,\n\nThose who know me are familiar with my predilection to suggest that situations are often better viewed not as “either/or” but as “both/and”. From my perspective, the College is very much experiencing a “both/and” moment that calls us to attend carefully to two important, though palpably dissimilar, things: the vibrant and familiar rhythm of the spring semester and the extraordinary challenges and existential complexities confronting higher education and so many aspects of our world. I find it impossible to write to you at this moment about one without the other.\n\nSpring Break has come and gone and signs abound that we are entering the final weeks of the academic year: early blooms are starting to color campus, students are deep in their studies, and our event calendar is filling rapidly with performances, readings, presentations, and exhibits. Over these next few weeks, Westlands Lawn will beckon our community to enjoy the unmatched beauty that is spring on campus, culminating in the blooming of the wisteria as we celebrate the Class of 2025 at Commencement.\n\nEarlier this week, we kicked off the senior art exhibitions that will run weekly until Open Studios at the end of April, and, beginning March 24, the Gallery at Heimbold will present Selections by Japanese-American wood-block printmaker and former faculty member Ansei Uchima. Our Polarization series recently hosted international human rights lawyer Oliver Windridge in conversation with history faculty member Philipp Nielsen and will conclude with the annual Adda Bozeman Lecture on April 2, featuring Ambassador Brooke Anderson '86. Our Admission team has sent acceptances to the Class of 2029, and our student tour guides are busily shepherding prospective students and their families around campus. Our student-athletes have been outdoing themselves this semester! The men’s basketball team had a program-best season, making it to the Skyline Conference Championship semifinals, and coach Chris Ehmer hit the 100-win milestone this season, while the women’s swim team also finished with a program-best season. And next week, I will head to Wadham College to join alumni and faculty for a special reunion celebrating the Sarah Lawrence College at Oxford program's 40th anniversary.\n\nIn other words, it’s all happening! There are many typical and memorable moments that mark the progress of the spring semester and point to the end of the academic year and the extraordinary accomplishments on campus. Yet, as we are all too aware, these events are taking place against a backdrop that is anything but typical. As I shared in my February letter to you, the College is working in multiple ways to anticipate, understand, and respond to the rapidly changing national landscape and its attendant threats to higher education broadly, Sarah Lawrence specifically, and our students most importantly. Dean Dave Stanfield and his team have been holding regular meetings with students to discuss concerns, share resources, and answer questions. I’ve met with faculty and staff on multiple occasions, joined by our general counsel, Joanna Silver, to share information, answer questions, and field concerns. And I continue to work closely with other college and university presidents and to rely on the College’s membership in a number of organizations at the state and national levels that provide guidance on navigating the changes and issues developing daily.In these last few weeks, I have found myself unable to avoid using adjectives I vowed to purge from my vocabulary after the height of the pandemic, but indeed feel compelled to acknowledge that we are living in unprecedented and uncertain times. So let me yet again assert the principles by which we live and the principles that we will continue to vigorously uphold and defend. We are committed to:\n\nEnsuring that every student at Sarah Lawrence has full and unimpeded access to our transformative education, regardless of race, gender identity, ethnicity, nationality or national origin, disability, socio-economic status, or religion.\n\nNurturing a global community that is diverse in every sense of the word, recognizing that a diversity of perspectives enriches learning, deepens empathy, and broadens our understanding of the world.\n\nFostering a community that values and upholds free expression and does so in a context of mutual respect.\n\nNot merely respecting but defending academic freedom and free inquiry as cornerstones of higher education.\n\nWhat does that mean at this moment? From the post-World War II period until quite recently, in broad terms, public and private U.S. higher education was seen as a common good, as a means of social and economic mobility, as a driver of research, discovery, and the knowledge economy, as an extraordinary American achievement not just admired, but aspired to, around the world. From the G.I. Bill and bi-partisan initiatives like Pell Grants, federal support for higher education focused on increasing access. The creation of federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, among many others, recognized the necessity of partnership with research universities. And it was not coincidental that the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities were added shortly after the Civil Rights Act, enshrining the values of the arts and humanities in the fabric of American life.\n\nThat ever-greater entwinement of federal government funding for private nonprofit higher education has always come with requirements of accreditation and compliance with federal law as a condition of accepting the funding. While such compliance and reporting are quite stringent, on the whole, the policies and procedures were clear, the goals of supporting students, reporting outcomes, and advancing research were shared, and within broad constraints appropriate deference was given to the critical role of academic freedom in advancing knowledge and broad institutional autonomy for private institutions with respect to academic and curricular decision-making.\n\nThis is no longer so. In ways and at a pace never before seen, the current administration appears to be choosing not just to remake but to attempt to dismantle that compact, using federal funding as a means of exerting influence and challenging a long-standing commitment to institutional independence. This shift threatens not only the financial stability of colleges and universities and the students and families they serve but also the broader role that higher education plays in a functioning democracy. And while the potential withholding of federal funding may be the most immediate and visible of a number of challenges facing higher education — challenges to which Sarah Lawrence will not be immune — other pressing issues, such as the specter of travel bans and the erosion of due process, will not only make it harder for undocumented, refugee, and international students to pursue an education in the U.S., but actively discourage it.\n\nI would not be surprised if you experience this as a highly bifurcated letter — “Here are all the amazing things happening on campus” / ”Higher education is facing serious and targeted threats” — but I believe that we can’t lose sight of one for the other. The “and” that connects this “both” is, and must continue to be, the ways we live out our collective commitment to the purpose and mission of this college: daily in the work of our students, faculty, and staff and in the larger context of a moment when higher education is in the crosshairs. While I have grudgingly invoked the “unprecedented uncertainty” cliche of my COVID communications, in doing so I am also reminded of our community’s perseverance and commitment to our values during those darkest days of the pandemic. Of how we “navigated the now” while simultaneously planning for a future beyond the chaos. This is another of those moments for Sarah Lawrence, sooner than we could ever have envisioned and in forms that we could scarcely have imagined. As we meet our promise to prepare our students to solve the problems of and thrive in a complex and rapidly evolving world, we as a college must rise once more to the challenge of providing the transformative education at the heart of all that we do. We do so by staying true to our mission and principles. And by remembering that the very essence of a liberal arts education — its dedication to critical thinking, creativity, and the pursuit of knowledge across disciplines — is precisely what is most needed, and most under threat, at this moment. In a world increasingly marked by polarization, the ability to engage across difference, to think deeply and critically, and to uphold the dignity and worth of all people is not optional, it is essential. This is the education we provide, and this is the education we must continue to defend.\n\nYours,\n\nCristle Collins Judd\n\nPresident\n\npresident@sarahlawrence.edu\n\nInstagram: @slcprez",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Sarah Lawrence Community,\n\nIn light of the rapidly evolving national landscape, I’m writing today to share some reflections as well as affirm our commitments as an institution. The early days of the new presidential administration have brought numerous executive orders and policy shifts that are causing widespread uncertainty. In addition to potential impacts on the College specifically and higher education more broadly, these developments deeply and directly affect members of our community in various and personal ways. As we navigate this moment and the days ahead together, I want to first and foremost assure you that the focus of the College remains clear and unwavering: to provide an environment in which all of our students can access and fully partake in this transformative education – an education that is more necessary than ever. We continue to be guided in this work by our mission: to foster a diverse and global community of learners, to nurture critical thought, to inspire intellectual courage, to cultivate engaged citizenship, and, above all, to prepare our students to solve the problems of, and thrive in, a complex and rapidly evolving world.\n\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to certain core principles: non-discrimination and respect for the flourishing of every individual; academic freedom; free expression; and mutual respect. We remain keenly aware of the need to defend and support the most vulnerable among us. And we believe — indeed, we know— that a diversity of perspectives enriches learning, deepens empathy, and broadens our understanding of the world. These principles are not just a set of ideals; rather, they are the foundation of who we are and what we stand for as an institution of higher education.\n\nAs I shared with you in November, the College’s ability to anticipate, understand, and respond to the rapid changes of late is bolstered by its membership in a number of organizations with which we collaborate and from whom we receive helpful guidance at both the national and state levels. Indeed it is through these institutions and associations that I believe the College can most effectively respond to proposed changes in federal policy and voice our concerns. I write this having just returned from Washington, DC, where with fellow college and university presidents I participated in the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU) annual meeting and advocacy day. Aptly, the theme of the meeting was “Advocacy Amidst Upheaval: Thriving in an Uncertain Political Era”. Working with NAICU and our other partners, I am focused on the most pressing policy issues affecting nonprofit, private higher education in general, and Sarah Lawrence in particular. These include issues related to gender identity and expression, international students and immigration, DEI, academic freedom and free speech, and funding for higher education, including especially all aspects of federal student aid funding. We are also closely monitoring three key legislative areas: Title IV, Title VI, and Title IX, all of which have enormous bearing on colleges and universities and the students we serve. NAICU’s analyses are public and I encourage you to explore their website for concise and up-to-date overviews of the tsunami of information coming out in the form of Executive Orders and their potential impact on higher education.\n\nWith and through our partners in higher education, we are advocating on behalf of our students and the College tirelessly. But even more persuasive and important will be the collective voices of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and families reaching out directly to their respective elected officials in Congress. I encourage you to make your voice heard in the days and months ahead on the issues that matter most to you. You can visit https://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ to find and reach out to your Representative, and https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/ to do the same with your home state Senators.\n\nMy time in Washington was a powerful confirmation of why and how much I value our Sarah Lawrence community and also a powerful reminder that Sarah Lawrence does not face these challenges in isolation. Likewise, the College is steadfast in its commitment that the members of our community will not face these challenges in isolation. We have been and will continue to reach out directly to students who may be most affected by these changes as we continue developing resources to support them.\n\nI have long said that our community is our strength. On a walk down Bates hill today after returning from DC, I was heartened by the message painted on the free expression board by students at the start of this semester, which reads: Unity is the key to our future. More than a reflection of our community’s hope and resilience, these words are a potent reminder that we are stronger together. As we move forward, I am confident that we will hold fast to this truth, supporting one another with purpose and conviction, and reaffirming our commitment to the values that define us and that make Sarah Lawrence the transformative place that it is.\n\nYours,\n\nCristle Collins Judd\n\nPresident\n\npresident@sarahlawrence.edu\n\nInstagram: @slcprez",

    "content": "Recipients of the 2025 Gitner Family Award for Innovation in Teaching with Technology and the University Provost’s Scholar-Teacher of the Year Award\n\nFrom Dr. Gloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nEach spring, we have the pleasure of announcing the recipients of two of our most prestigious University-wide teaching awards: the Gerald and Deanne Gitner Family Award for Innovation in Teaching with Technology and the Boston University Provost’s Scholar-Teacher of the Year Award.\n\nThese awards each year give us a chance to recognize some of the most innovative and creative members of our academic community and the outstanding work they are doing to advance the practice of teaching and explore new frontiers in the creation and transmission of knowledge.\n\n2025 Gerald and Deanne Gitner Family Award for Innovation in Teaching with Technology\n\nSupported through the generosity of BU alumnus Gerald Gitner (CAS ’66), his wife Deanne, and their family, the Gitner Award recognizes the faculty member or team that best exemplifies innovation in teaching by use, development, or adaptation of technology. The award celebrates innovation that results in positive learning outcomes for undergraduate students and that is recognized or adopted by faculty colleagues within or outside Boston University. The recipient of this year’s Gitner Family Award for Innovation in Teaching with Technology is Dr. Elizabeth Co, senior lecturer of biology in the College of Arts & Sciences.\n\nDr. Co has been cited for her efforts to support anatomy and biology students through the adoption of software that lets her measure the success of her own teaching methods and pinpoint – using student performance data – the pedagogical practices that best enhance critical thinking.\n\nWhen Dr. Co first adopted the ExamSoft program, it was to upgrade the visual quality of anatomy images she used on exams, enabling students to manipulate and zoom in on high-resolution color pictures on their devices, without allowing for cheating. An added bonus of the software was the ability to break down and identify the types of questions where students performed notably better (memorization and understanding) and those requiring more time and attention (application and analysis). Using that data, Dr. Co quickly realized the only way to improve students’ ability to not only digest but apply new knowledge was by increasing critical thinking opportunities in class. Virtually overnight, she transformed her classroom to provide more time applying those skills through case studies and problem sets. Within weeks, student performance on final exams was strong across all areas with marked improvement in critical thinking.\n\nNews of Dr. Co’s success and adoption of ExamSoft spread quickly across the biology department and later to programs within other schools. It would serve a key role during the COVID pandemic, as Dr. Co led efforts to implement the technology University-wide and mentor faculty on its use to provide students with detailed feedback during remote learning.\n\nToday nearly 10,000 BU students use ExamSoft in one or more of their classes, and Dr. Co’s work has resulted in numerous publications, workshops for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Science Foundation, and international conference presentations. “Dr. Co is what all other professors should strive to be,” writes one of her students. “Her class is challenging but so rewarding in the end because she teaches her students to think critically and reason their way through every question and case study.”\n\n2025 Boston University Provost’s Scholar-Teacher of the Year Award\n\nThe University Provost’s Scholar-Teacher of the Year Award recognizes outstanding scholars who excel as teachers inside and outside the classroom and who contribute to the art and science of teaching and learning. The embrace of this dual role – scholar and teacher – is at the heart of Boston University’s mission, and this year it is our pleasure to recognize Dr. Lei Tian, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering in the College of Engineering.\n\nProfessor Tian has been cited for his ability to create dynamic learning environments and curricula that deftly integrate cutting-edge research and empower students to become active participants in discovery. Professor Tian has earned global recognition for pioneering research that combines physical optics with computational algorithms to advance the state-of-the-art in areas such as biomedical imaging, microscopy, and remote sensing. A current Scialog Fellow in Advancing BioImaging, he has received major grants to support his research, including a National Science Foundation CAREER Award and a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative award for creating an imaging platform that leads to new treatments and targets for drug development. His innovations have garnered BU honors as well, including the Hariri Institute for Computing’s Research Incubation Award and the College of Engineering’s Early Career Excellence in Research Award.\n\nProfessor Tian’s drive to advance new technologies is rivaled only by his gift for distinctive course design and the care he devotes to mentoring and preparing new engineers. In courses like Computational Optical Imaging and Signals & Systems, students routinely speak of the interactive lectures and hands-on lab components he employs to boost engagement and foster critical thinking. In lieu of traditional final exams, he designs group-based research projects that encourage students to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems, mirroring the challenges they will face in their professional careers. The goal: ensuring students feel confident taking risks and enjoy the journey of exploration. Writes one student, “His dedication to ensuring each student grasps the material is evident, and his approachability fosters an environment where questions are encouraged and learning flourishes.

    "content": "Organizational Changes in the Office of the University Provost\n\nFrom Dr. Gloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nI am writing to share a few structural changes within the Office of the Provost. My vision is that this new structure will streamline our operations, foster greater collaboration across the University, and enhance our ability to support our faculty, staff, and students.\n\nFirst, to strengthen strategic planning and resource management, we are re-envisioning key areas to provide cross-cutting advisory support across academic units. Academic Initiatives & Operational Excellence, led by Associate Provost Sarah Hokanson, will take on an important role in supporting college-level strategy and operational excellence, including oversight of Academic Program Review and Strategic Communicationswithin the Office of the Provost. This area will also grow its portfolio to provide leadership for University-wide services, including the University Libraries, the Center for Career Development, Student Wellbeing, and the Newbury Center.\n\nSecond, Victoria Sahani, Associate Provost for Community & Inclusion, has let me know that she intends to return to the faculty of the School of Law effective July 1. I am grateful for the work of Victoria and her team and look forward to recognizing her many contributions later this summer. With Victoria’s transition, Community & Inclusion will move under the Office of the President. Connecting this work more concretely to the strategic priorities in the Office of the President will allow us to best support our students, faculty, and staff moving forward.\n\nThird, to ensure our graduate enrollment goals are fully integrated with our broader graduate strategy, Graduate Enrollment, led by Associate Vice President David Cotter, has been integrated into Graduate Affairs, led by Associate Provost Sean Mullen. The former Professional Development & Postdoctoral Affairs unit has also been reimagined within Graduate Affairs and will continue to serve all graduate and professional students as well as postdoctoral scholars.\n\nFinally, Enrollment & Student Administration, currently led by Vice President ad interim Christopher Sedore, is doing critical work that aligns closely with presidential priorities and will therefore become integrated into the Office of the President.\n\nThese changes reflect our commitment to continuous improvement and our intention to align the Office of the Provost more closely with the University’s evolving needs and strategic priorities. I hope this broader visibility into our structure helps clarify how we are working to advance our shared mission. I look forward to continued collaboration as we move ahead.\n\nOrganizational Changes in the Office of the University Provost – 5.1.25\n\nView all posts",

Convergent research integrates diverse fields—from, and not limited to, the sciences, engineering, and medicine to public policy and business—to address scientific questions and help solve complex societal challenges. Boston University’s researchers who work in this way have already driven breakthroughs in health, synthetic biology, neurophotonics, climate science, and AI.\n\nThe task force will be charged with making recommendations on how to best adopt convergence, University-wide and within individual schools and colleges. This effort will further our ability to make transformative contributions to society, remain highly competitive for external funding for our research and educational programs, excel in educating the future workforce, and continue attracting intellectually fearless and ambitious faculty and students to our University.\n\nThe task force will be charged with seeking the valuable perspectives of faculty and staff from across the University. In addition, the task force will have the following objectives:\n\nDetermine how to position BU so we remain a leader in convergent research, including gathering information about effective practices adopted at peer institutions and developing strategies for identifying new and emergent areas for convergent research and education Identify current organizational barriers to convergent research and teaching that can be removed to make it easier for researchers from different fields and across our campuses to collaborate effectively Recommend key investments from Boston University and external partners to catalyze success in convergent research and education Determine best approaches for recruiting new talent and developing current faculty Examine the role convergence should play to enhance undergraduate and graduate educational programs and better prepare graduates to embrace the power of working across disciplines Identify metrics, short- and long-term, that could be used to measure and track success of our efforts over time\n\nWe are grateful to the task force members for their service and especially to cochairs Ken Lutchen, professor of biomedical engineering and senior advisor to the president for strategy and innovation, and Darrell Kotton, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine.\n\nWe have asked the task force to share their initial set of recommendations by July 1, 2025, which we look forward to sharing broadly with the University community. From there, we will work together to implement their most compelling ideas.\n\nWe are confident that with this focused initiative, in conjunction with our proven history of excellence in research, we will develop an institutional strategy for convergence that charts a bold future for research, leverages and builds on our many strengths, and uniquely positions Boston University to achieve eminence in this area for years to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam, President\n\nGloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nBoston University Task Force on Convergent Research and Education\n\nCochairs:\n\nDarrell Kotton, Professor of Medicine, Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine; Director, Center for Regenerative Medicine\n\nKenneth Lutchen, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering; Senior Advisor to the President for Strategy & Innovation\n\nMembers:\n\nDavid Boas, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering; Director, Neurophotonics Center\n\nDeborah Carr, Arts & Sciences Distinguished Professor of Sociology, College of Arts & Sciences; Director, Center for Innovation in Social Science\n\nChristopher Chen, William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor; Professor of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering\n\nKevin Gallagher, Professor of Global Development Policy, Frederick S.

    "content": "Effects of Federal Budget Directives on University Funding\n\nFrom Dr. Melissa Gilliam, President,\n\nDr. Gloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer,\n\nand Nicole Tirella, Senior Vice President for Financial Affairs, CFO, and Treasurer\n\nJanuary 28, 2025\n\nDear Members of the BU Community,\n\nAs you’ve likely seen in the news, in the past week the new administration has issued executive orders affecting federal funding agencies. We are writing to update you on these directives and the steps the University is taking at this time. Below, we outline the current state of affairs, how you can keep abreast of the situation, and the University’s ongoing actions to support our community. Know that the University remains committed to supporting our campus community and researchers with federal grants.\n\nOn Monday, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo imposing a temporary pause on all activities related to the obligation or disbursement of federal financial assistance. No new federal grants will be awarded and no new funding will be disbursed until the pause is lifted. It is important to note that earlier this afternoon, a federal judge blocked the OMB’s funding freeze until Monday, February 3. While we are uncertain of the outcome of this legal action, the University is working vigilantly to prepare for the freeze’s impact on our campus should the injunction be lifted.\n\nIn the event the OMB’s orders are allowed to proceed, agencies will have until Monday, February 10 to submit plans to OMB demonstrating compliance with recent executive orders, which you can find linked from the Office of Research website. In addition to the pause, the memo mandates that agencies designate a senior political appointee responsible for ensuring that federal financial assistance aligns with administration priorities. Agencies would also be required, to the extent permissible by law, to cancel any previously awarded grants that conflict with these priorities.\n\nThe memo covers a broad range of areas, and schools and organizations nationwide are assessing its potential impact. The Department of Education has stated that federal Pell Grants and direct loans under Title IV would not be affected. At the same time, we recognize that this pause would be disruptive to our research programs and represent a departure from previous norms.\n\nThe University remains committed to supporting everyone in our community during this transition, including faculty with federal grants. Should the pause be reinstated, no preemptive action would be taken on individual awards prior to February 10. Unless the sponsor has issued a stop-work order, researchers should continue conducting research on federal grants through the pause. We also understand that many researchers have concerns about specific grants and programs. Please send your questions to Sponsored Programs at ospera@bu.edu, and our Sponsored Programs team will compile them, provide responses, and develop FAQs around common issues.\n\nAdditional guidance is being released rapidly. We will continue to monitor the evolving situation and provide general updates on the Office of Research website. We also encourage you to check the Federal Relations website and sign up for their newsletter for the latest information.\n\nThank you for your patience and cooperation as we work through this temporary pause together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam\n\nPresident\n\nGloria Waters\n\nUniversity Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nNicole Tirella\n\nSenior Vice President for Financial Affairs, CFO, and Treasurer\n\nEffects of Federal Budget Directives on University Funding – 1.28.25\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "Results of Campus Climate Survey and Next Steps\n\nFrom Dr. Gloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nLast spring, we invited a representative sample of Boston University students to take part in a climate survey on sexual assault and sexual misconduct. Conducted in partnership with Rankin Climate LLC, a nationally recognized climate assessment firm, the survey was designed to gauge student perceptions of BU’s campus climate and knowledge of University resources related to sexual misconduct.\n\nWe recently received the data from this effort and have posted an executive summary of the survey’s findings on our website. I am now appointing a working group to engage deeply with the data to understand its implications and make recommendations for appropriate next steps. As the working group conducts its work, it will solicit feedback from the BU community.\n\nAmong BU’s highest priorities is providing a safe, healthy, and nondiscriminatory environment for all members of our community. While we have taken a number of steps in recent years to raise awareness of this issue and reduce the rate of sexual misconduct in our community, we know we still have progress to make to achieve our goal of a harassment-free community.\n\nThis topic is sensitive and profoundly personal for many individuals, and we sincerely appreciate everyone who took the time to participate in the survey. Confidential resources are available should you wish to speak with someone about your experience or after reviewing the materials. This brochure provides further details and a list of confidential resources at BU.\n\nFostering a safe campus environment and promoting a culture of respect is a collective responsibility for all members of the BU community. Thank you to the students who participated in this survey and to all of you for your continued support and engagement with this important initiative.\n\nResults of Campus Climate Survey and Next Steps – 1.23.25\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "Absences for Religious Observances\n\nFrom Dr. Gloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nAs we being a new semester, I am writing to restate Boston University’s commitment to respecting the practice of all religious denominations. During the course of the academic year, members of our community may request excused absences from attending classes or participating in examination, work, or study requirements in order to accommodate the observance of their religious faiths. A full reading of the University’s Policy on Absence for Religious Reasons may be found here: https://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/absence-for-religious-reasons/.\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that no student or member of the faculty may be penalized for such absences and must be provided a reasonable opportunity to make up any assignments, work, or examinations missed. Faculty members, likewise, have the authority – should they seek it – to cancel classes in order to accommodate religious observances, so long as provisions are made to cover the required course content. For a multi-faith list of religious holidays and dates for the 2024-2025 academic year, please visit the Marsh Chapel website. If you have any questions, please contact Marsh Chapel at chapel@bu.edu or 617-353-3560.\n\nThank you for your attention to this policy and for your ongoing cooperation. I wish everyone a productive and successful spring semester.\n\nAbsences for Religious Observances – 1.22.25\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "At the 169th Tufts University commencement, speaker Freeman A. Hrabowski III delivered a message to graduates that he first heard during his college commencement in 1970. “You’ll go further in life than you can ever imagine,” he said, echoing Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to be elected to Congress.\n\n“You’ll see more than you thought possible and make such a difference. But you must speak your truth. You must support each other and dream in the possibilities,” Hrabowski, who was president of University of Maryland, Baltimore County for 30 years, told the 3,640 graduates and their friends and families on the Academic Quad.\n\nChisholm was one of many prominent historical figures who Hrabowski highlighted because they fought for and brought about positive change in the world despite sometimes overwhelming obstacles. Their stories of strife helped shape Hrabowski’s life path.\n\nHe opened his address quoting the poem “On the Pulse of Morning” from author and civil rights activist Maya Angelou that expresses similar themes of hope and resilience:\n\nHere, on the pulse of this new day\n\nYou may have the grace to look up and out\n\nAnd into your sister’s eyes, and into\n\nYour brother’s face, your country\n\nAnd say simply\n\nVery simply\n\nWith hope—\n\nGood morning.\n\n“Every one of you has a story,” Hrabowski reminded graduates. “I want you to think about your story of how you got here, of your parents, grandparents, and others. You stand on all their shoulders.”\n\nWistia Video URL\n\nHe shared that his own story began with a frightening experience as a child in Birmingham, Alabama. Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., Hrabowski was 12 years old when he marched in a peaceful protest at a time of segregated schools for better education for Black children. The protesters intended to kneel and pray on the steps of the Birmingham City Hall, but instead, they were arrested and he spent five days in jail.\n\n“I’ll never forget being so afraid. And Dr. King told us, ‘What you do this day will have an impact on generations.’ And somehow, we sensed this was a profound message,” he recalled. “That was 1963, and within the next few years, we saw the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the Higher Education Act.”\n\nHe pointed out that, in the 1960s, Tufts University would not have had a president named Sunil Kumar, and a research university would not have had a female provost like Tufts does today. He said the governor of Alabama at the time told him he could not go to the University of Alabama because he was Black.\n\nPhoto: Matthew Healy\n\n“There are times when things get dark, and we wonder, will we be OK? But all of a sudden, things happen and get better—they really do,” he said.\n\nIn that spirit, Hrabowski challenged the graduates to believe in themselves and quoted Eleanor Roosevelt, the longtime First Lady and political activist, who said: “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”\n\nHrabowski said that “the question for today is, who are you? Not just who do you want to become, but who are you and who do you want to become? The way you think about yourselves, the language you use, the way you interact with each other, the values that you hold, will so important.”\n\n“Don’t let anybody else define who you are,” he said. “Dream big, prepare to serve and to lead. You are well prepared. Roll up your sleeves. Get ready for the fight. You are ready to change the world, because you were born to change the world.”\n\nPhoto: Paul Rutherford\n\nUnder Hrabowski’s leadership, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County was among the top-ranked schools nationally in innovation and STEM leadership.\n\nHis research and publications focused on science and math education, with special emphasis on minority participation and performance. He wrote numerous articles and co-authored five books based on his research and program outcomes. He chaired the National Academies’ committee that produced the report Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America’s Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads.",

    "content": "Last month marked the conclusion of the pilot offering of the Tufts Leadership Experience. Launched in June 2024, the executive leadership development program gave 22 employees from across Tufts the opportunity to explore, learn, and practice Tufts’ core leadership competencies through in-person and virtual instructor-led training.\n\nAccording to Mike Howard, executive vice president, the pilot offering was designed to build the competencies essential for successful executive leadership at Tufts in an increasingly complex and evolving landscape.\n\n“Today’s leaders must be able to work with diverse stakeholders, navigate financial pressures, integrate fast-moving technological innovations, and navigate competing priorities with disciplined focus,” said Howard. “All these requirements demand an approach to leadership that is accountable to others, that’s emotionally intelligent, and that drives change in ways that are aligned with our mission.”\n\nIntended for employees who report to the most senior level in their school or unit, the program is designed for individuals with consistently high levels of performance to date as well as the potential to assume executive leadership roles within the next five years.\n\n“Tufts plays an important role in supporting the continued success of our incredible staff,” said Caroline Genco, provost and senior vice president. “As a leadership development program, the Tufts Leadership Experience not only enhances individual capabilities, but it also strengthens and supports the university.”\n\nOne of the exercises built into the program was a deep dive into mission statements and the strategic planning process. For participant Dana Fleming, associate general counsel, that activity yielded a valuable insight: “That exercise exposed for me the reactive nature of a lot of my work and helped me think about prioritization not just as a time management tool, productivity hack, or survival skill, but as a way to empower and take care of myself and those around me.”\n\n“It allowed me to consider prioritization not as a way to cram a million tasks into every waking minute, but almost as a sign of respect for yourself and the importance of the work you do,” Fleming said.\n\nThe program emphasized the importance of leaders—and everyone—having the skill to understand issues through a variety of perspectives, said Tony Luongo, senior director of administration at the School of Arts and Sciences. “Participating in the program with colleagues of diverse backgrounds and from a variety of schools and divisions provided valuable insight into how differently each person processes similar problems or requests,” he said.\n\nThe program also featured interactive presentations from members of the university’s senior leadership team, augmented by related readings, podcasts, and webinars.\n\nHelena Han, director of strategy and operations for the provost’s office, echoed Luongo’s sentiment. “It’s been a game-changer to realize just how much people’s communication preferences, decision-making styles, and motivators can vary,” she said. “That awareness has made my relationships with colleagues much more effective and genuine.”\n\nYolanda Smith, chief of police and executive director of public safety, said she loved the program’s focus on supporting others. “It reminded me to invest in people regardless of what's happening in this dynamic environment we’re working in,” she said. “Happy employees produce better results and outcomes.”\n\nThe program was offered in collaboration with Starfish vILT, a company specializing in leadership development. Tufts Human Resources will solicit nominations in the coming weeks for an early fall launch for the program’s second cohort.",

    "content": "CommuniTEA, a new initiative launched by the Office of the Vice Provost for Institutional Inclusive Excellence, is a monthly community gathering that takes place during the academic year, offering a space for employees to connect with one another outside of their daily workplace interactions.\n\n“We are eager to welcome staff across the university to come together in these monthly gatherings, for joy, connection, and community,” said Tiffany Enos, associate provost for inclusive staff and administrative excellence in the Office of the Vice Provost for Institutional Inclusive Excellence.\n\nCommuniTEA allows participants to get to know each other by way of activities including craft-making while also enjoying coffee, tea, and snacks. The events are designed as a relaxing environment for attendees to talk to fellow Tufts community members whom they might not otherwise have a chance to meet and, in the process, become more familiar with new offices around the university.\n\n“It was nice to hash a few conversations while relaxing for an hour,” said Jordan Wilkinson, senior research administrator in the Office of the Vice Provost for Research. “I mostly work remotely in a research-related office and don't get to meet all that many people. Today, I got to meet someone that's working at Tisch College and another person working at the Africana Center. It turns out we've both been staff here for years and just never connected.”\n\nCommuniTEA conversations can also lead to future professional collaborations, as Hannah Clifford, assistant director of student and young alumni engagement in the Office of Alumni Engagement, and Ann Ward, sustainability manager in the Office of Sustainability, discovered. As a result of their meeting at the April 29 event, Clifford and Ward may now begin working together to engage students and alumni with similar interests.\n\n“I have some alumni that want to do something with renewable energy, and I didn't really know where to point them to,” said Clifford. “Having the opportunity to have my conversation [with Ward], I feel like I now have some more resources in my pocket and can reopen that conversation and point the alums in the right direction.”\n\n“I was telling Hannah that I know for certain, as somebody who works with a lot of students in the Office of Sustainability, that our students would love to hear from her alumni,” added Ward. “It was a really great connection that I don't think I would've made otherwise.”\n\nCommuniTEA events are currently happening on the Medford/Somerville campus on the last Tuesday of each month. The next event will take place on Tuesday, May 27 in the Austin Room in Tisch Library; staff and administrators who are interested in attending upcoming CommuniTEA events can register here.",

    "content": "Innovation is a keystone of research at Tufts, as seen by the university being named one of the top 100 U.S. universities granted utility patents—also known as patents for invention—for 2024 by the National Academy of Inventors (NAI).\n\nUtility patents encompass many types of scientific breakthroughs that directly benefit society and human health, with potential for the creation of useful products that better the world.\n\n“Research and innovation are inseparable,” said Bernard Arulanandam, vice provost for research. “At Tufts, our researchers bring ideas to life—and break new ground—in ways that lead to meaningful discoveries and real-world innovations, as reflected in the numerous patents awarded to us last year.”\n\nA number of these patents have been optioned or licensed by commercial parties for further development, including clinical trials. Last year, 30 patents were awarded in total. Tufts ranks 68 out of 100 on the NAI list.\n\n“Global competition in science and technology is intense,” said U.S. National Science Foundation director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “To continue to keep our nation secure, we must invest in accelerating breakthrough technologies, transitioning these technologies to the market, and preparing Americans for better-quality, higher-wage jobs.”\n\nA selection of patents drawn from across the university include the following faculty:\n\nSchool of Arts and Sciences\n\nMisha Kilmer, William Walker Professor of Mathematics, who holds a secondary appointment in computer science, received a patent for deep tensor neural networks—an innovation that transforms AI model architecture. These networks excel at capturing high-dimensional correlations in data through tensor-based representations, allowing them to detect subtle patterns that traditional models miss. By effectively modeling the intricate relationships between multiple data dimensions simultaneously, tensor networks achieve superior generalization on smaller datasets. This mathematical breakthrough enables more efficient processing of complex data for applications in image recognition, speech processing, and scientific analysis, while providing comprehensive tools for building and optimizing these powerful, adaptable models.\n\nSchool of Dental Medicine\n\nPamela C. Yelick, professor of Basic and Clinical Translational Sciences, director of the Division of Craniofacial and Molecular Genetics, Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, and professor of biomedical engineering, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, holds a patent that introduces a specialized gel designed to assist in regenerating the soft tissue inside teeth, known as dental pulp. This gel mimics the natural environment of dental pulp and contains bioactive proteins and that promote tissue growth and blood vessel and nerve formation, revitalizing the tooth. Such a development could lead to advanced treatments for tooth repair, potentially reducing the need for traditional root canal procedures.\n\nSchool of Engineering\n\nAyse Asatekin, associate professor and Steve and Kristen Remondi Faculty Fellow in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, holds two patents related to filtration. The first concerns a specialized filter that has a thin, nanoporous layer composed of polymeric nanoparticles, formed during the coating process, on a support with larger pores. These membranes can be functionalized to selectively filter, pass, or capture specific substances based on their chemical properties. Such membranes can be utilized in water purification, chemical processing, or medical diagnostics to efficiently separate desired components from complex mixtures. The second is for a new manufacturing method that enables fabrication of filtration membranes with high permeability and selectivity. This approach is faster than existing methods, as it does not require post-processing steps, and can be used to fabricate a broad range of membrane categories, such as nanofiltration.\n\nCummings School of Veterinary Medicine\n\nCharles Shoemaker, professor in the Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health, is an inventor on three patents, which collectively seek to use VHH binding proteins as therapeutics for C. difficile and botulinum toxin-related diseases. The patents describe recombinant VHH binding proteins capable of specifically targeting and neutralizing toxins produced by Clostridioides difficile and Botulinum bacteria, and compositions and kits containing these VHH binding proteins, as well as methods for producing and using VHH binding proteins.\n\nFriedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy\n\nSimin Meydani, professor emerita of nutrition, and Mohsen Meydani, professor emeritus of nutrition, are inventors on a patent that covers a composition and method for treating, preventing, and reducing the risk of obesity, inflammatory conditions, and related diseases, as well as increasing gut microbiome diversity, immunity, cognition, muscle mass, and longevity. The composition is derived from fruits and vegetables, and can be formulated as a dry powder, capsule, or liquid; as a nutritional supplement, food, or beverage. This approach offers a potential dietary intervention for managing weight and promoting overall health and longevity.\n\nSchool of Medicine\n\nThe late Andrew Bohm, associate professor of developmental, molecular and chemical biology, is an inventor on a patent for a novel method for efficiently generating edited DNA, ranging from DNA molecules with simple point mutations to complex DNA libraries. The methods and kits use a single-stranded deoxyuridine (dU)-containing template to align a series of DNA oligomers that contain mutations relative to the template strand, giving rise to the sequence variation in the product. The methods and kits may be used to produce DNA libraries or to generate multiple, widely spaced mutations in a target sequence.\n\nA complete list of the Tufts lead inventors associated with 2023 patents follows.\n\nSchool of Arts and Sciences\n\nTimothy Atherton , professor (Physics and Astronomy)\n\nMisha Kilmer , William Walker Professor of Mathematics (Mathematics)\n\nKrishna Kumar , Robinson Professor (Chemistry)\n\nCharles Mace , associate professor (Chemistry)\n\nDavid Walt (Chemistry)\n\nSchool of Dental Medicine\n\nJake Jinkun Chen , professor (Basic & Clinical Translational Science)\n\nQisheng Tu , professor (Basic & Clinical Translational Science)\n\nPamela C.

    "content": "Beginning this month, all Tufts students and faculty can visit any museum at Harvard University free of charge, year-round. To be eligible for free admission, they simply need to show their Tufts ID. All current Tufts students and faculty are eligible.\n\nWhile some of the Harvard museums are already free to the public, Tufts students and faculty will have free admission to all of them, including:\n\n“We want to encourage all our students, as part of their Tufts education, to access the widest possible range of cultural and historical resources available to them,” said Cigdem Talgar, vice provost for education. “Harvard’s museums are an outstanding example of what is on offer to students who come to Boston to pursue their education.”\n\nThe inspiration for the free admission plan came from Noel Heim, a lecturer in the Department of Earth and Climate Sciences. He wanted to give the 225 students enrolled in his “Dinosaurs!” course an assignment related to the dinosaur fossils at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. He discussed the idea with his department chair, which ultimately led to Tufts paying an annual fee for student access to the Harvard museum network. Faculty who would like to bring their larger classes as a group are just asked to coordinate with the specific museum in advance.\n\nHeim said he hopes other departments and programs take advantage of this new resource for deepening their curricular offerings. “I also hope students just go on their own,” he said. “It’s so close and a great museum.”\n\nNotable among the exhibits at Harvard is the unique collection of glass models of plants—known as the Glass Flowers—at the Museum of Natural History; other exhibits at this museum include collections of rare gems and minerals and six whale skeletons. The Museum of the Ancient Near East features casts of famous Mesopotamian monuments and tablets holding the earliest forms of writing. The Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments contains more than 20,000 objects drawn from a broad range of scientific disciplines.\n\nAdmission to the museums also extends to Tufts students and faculty the opportunity to take classes offered to guests of the museum and to attend weekly lectures and special events, including ArtsThursdays.\n\nThis initiative is part of ongoing efforts by the Office of the Provost to open up new opportunities for experiential learning for Tufts students.",

    "content": "When talking about antisemitism, the Jewish training and support organization known as Project Shema doesn’t always rely on the term antisemitism.\n\n“We often shift our language from the word ‘antisemitism’ to the frame of ‘anti-Jewish harm,’ says Zach Schaffer, Project Shema’s co-founder and vice president of community engagement. “We want to be able to identify and describe ideas and actions that erode safety and inclusion, and we think this can depolarize this conversation in a lot of ways.”\n\nProject Shema (pronounced Sh’ma, the Hebrew word for “hear”) has been engaged by Tufts this spring for a two-part workshop at Tufts to support inclusion and belonging for the Jewish community. The events have been sponsored by the Office of the Vice Provost for Institutional Inclusive Excellence, Tufts University Chaplaincy, and Tufts Hillel as part of the Tufts Inclusive Education Series (TIES).\n\nThe first session took place online on March 27, and an in-person follow-up dialogue session took place on the Medford/Somerville campus on April 6. Each of the workshop’s two parts were open to all undergraduates and graduate students at Tufts.\n\nIn its work, Schaffer says, Shema offers a “tone and tenor of conversation that really invites everyone in, regardless of their values, of their political identity, or of the contexts and communities that they exist in.”\n\n“We create a space where everyone feels welcome, everyone feels heard, and everyone can be empathized with,” he says. “And we can do that while still grappling with the most difficult questions.”\n\nSchaffer spoke with Tufts Now about the work of Project Shema.\n\nWhat does Project Shema mean when it talks about antisemitism or anti-Jewish harm?\n\nProject Shema has never endorsed or promoted any other organizations’ definition of antisemitism in our work. We’re helping participants have the empathy, the understanding of Jewish lived experiences and of how anti-Jewish harm happens, so that our participants can identify anti-Jewish harm themselves, unpack their own anti-Jewish biases, and change and challenge their biases about Jews.\n\nRather than a one-size-fits-all definition of antisemitism, we shift the focus to explore what anti-Jewish harm looks like. Our focus is on disrupting ideas and actions that undermine individual and collective Jewish inclusion and safety, and to do that in a way that nurtures safety for everyone.\n\nWhat are the specific dimensions of antisemitism, and how is it similar, and different, from other types of hatred?\n\nOne way we understand antisemitism is as a systemic bigotry that has existed for thousands of years, and that we are all socialized and conditioned into. No one is exempt from having biases or bigotry about Jews. They’re in the fabric of our society, and this is one of the ways in which antisemitism, or anti-Jewish harm, ideas are similar to some of the other forms of hatred and bigotry.\n\nOne thing that makes antisemitism different than some other forms of harm is that antisemitism is not only a systemic bigotry, but it is also a conspiracy theory, an ancient and malleable conspiracy theory that includes a set of ideas about Jews, and motifs about Jewish power, Jewish untrustworthiness, Jewish corruption and greed, and Jewish evilness. These ideas always morph to meet the moment in different cultures.\n\nWe understand antisemitism is something that, of course, harms Jews. And in our workshops, we help people understand the unique ways in which antisemitism undermines collective Jewish safety. We also understand antisemitism as something that fuels white supremacy, undermines democratic institutions, and erodes pluralism, making everyone in society less safe, especially marginalized communities.\n\nHow long has Project Shema been doing this work?\n\nWe were founded in 2022 by Jewish leaders, including myself, with deep ties in social justice movements. We had been working on curriculum and learning a couple of years prior to that.\n\nHow, if at all, did the events of Oct. 7, 2023, affect your mission or the way you did outreach?\n\nOur mission has always been to stop the normalization of ideas that undermine collective Jewish inclusion and safety. And we’ve always believed that collective Jewish safety can only be ensured within healthy and pluralistic societies. Since October 7, the need for this work has grown tremendously. Jews are experiencing a terrible uptick in demonization, exclusion, and harm. And since October 7, more and more friends outside of our community are understanding the need to show up as allies. So, we are expanding our work with allies and meeting their need for a compassionate, nuanced, depolarized conversation about Jewish identity and antisemitism.\n\nWho are your audiences?\n\nWe work with both Jews and non-Jewish audiences. A lot of our work in this moment has been with non-Jewish partners, colleagues, and communities, and we have been incredibly grateful over the last couple of years to see so many people eagerly show up to our workshops in every context to build their skills as friends and allies. They do the hard work of unpacking their own biases and trying to better understand our community’s lived experiences, diversity, traumas, and experiences of harm.\n\nOften our partners are relieved to be able to enter such a difficult and, at times, politicized and polarized conversation in a way that contains so much curiosity, compassion, grace, and nuance.\n\nProject Shema's website talks about “new ways to engage peers who don't wish to harm the Jewish people, but may accidentally perpetuate anti-Jewish harm.” Can you expand on that?\n\nI believe we’re all socialized into anti-Jewish prejudices and biases, and that none of us is exempt from the cultural conditioning of anti-Jewish ideas. I do not understand antisemitism as just a sentiment—one does not have to have malice toward Jews, or hatred toward Jews, to believe ideas about Jews that are harmful or that are grounded in unconscious or implicit bias or conspiracy theories. While I have met people who hate Jews, and I have personally experienced aggressive antisemitism, I have found in most of our work that most people do not wish to cause harm and do not have the context necessary to understand the impact of their language or actions.\n\nSo when I meet someone who perpetuates anti-Jewish harm with their language or actions, I recognize they may not have hatred or malice toward Jews and they may not be aware that their actions or language are even causing any harm. This is why we approach all of our partners and participants with unbearable compassion and unwavering grace.\n\nWhen you say “we’re all socialized into anti-Jewish prejudices and biases,” would you include Jews in that group?\n\nLiving in society means we are all, including Jews, going to be socialized into certain ideas about who Jews are and what Jews look like and what it means to be Jewish. So we certainly all have to do the work to unpack, change, and challenge those biases. No one, including me, is immune to these ideas.",

    "content": "On Tuesday evening, March 25, while walking on a public sidewalk from her off-campus home to a community Iftar at the university’s Interfaith Center, Tufts graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk was taken into custody by a group of federal authorities. (The university has since filed a declaration in support of Öztürk’s legal filings in federal district court in Massachusetts.)\n\nWithin hours, Tufts International Center had mobilized resources in full support of the members of the university’s international community. By 9 a.m. on Wednesday, March 26, the I-Center was set up to offer support virtually to its population, with all of the center’s advisors on hand to triage calls from students, scholars, and employees across Tufts.\n\n“Some people had very specific questions, while others just wanted a chance to connect and convey their anxieties” said Anna Garson, director of the International Center. “When it came to answering those questions, our advisors are deeply well versed in immigration issues. And to the latter point, they’re in this field because they care about supporting students and they’re skilled in providing empathetic support to folks in sensitive situations,\" Garson said. \"They did a lot of that last week.”\n\nIn addition to the virtual support, the I-Center team also organized in-person opportunities across Tufts’ schools and campuses for individuals to be in community together.\n\nTo learn more about the response of the university and the International Center in support of the university’s international community, Tufts Now spoke with Garson and Cigdem Talgar, vice provost for education.\n\nWhat are you hearing from international community members right now?\n\nGarson: We’re used to responding to dozens of questions each week from students, scholars, and employees, on topics like immigration status, travel documents, and the U.S. immigration system.\n\nBut now, on top of that, we’re fielding more than 100 questions each day, with students asking if they’re safe in their classrooms, their research labs, or their homes—or walking to the grocery store. We’ve had questions from scholars about whether or not they should go to see a sick family member, out of fear that they're not able going to be able to get back into the country … questions about participating in a study abroad or research trip … questions about if the way they dress or if their participation in their religious practice makes them a target. As reflected in all these questions and more, our community is, understandably, very scared.\n\nWhat supports are available?\n\nGarson: At the International Center, we’re helping students understand the documents that they need to carry. We are compiling links to and information about campus resources and immigration procedures—and putting everything in writing for ease of access by students. We also field questions from students who have concerns about where they are living.\n\nWe also closely monitor SEVIS [Student and Exchange Visitor Information System] to which we, as I-Center staff, have access, very close contact with our counterparts at other universities and institutions locally, sharing information and making sure we’re being as proactive as we can be.\n\nAnd in addition to what our own team provides directly for our population, we continue to actively share resources from teams like the University Chaplaincy, Counseling and Mental Health Services, and Student Support, among others.\n\nTalgar: We want students to hear this: if you need flexibility and support in your teaching or learning, reach out to your professors—and scholars, reach out to your deans or chairs. We have mechanisms set up to respond to these needs. And CELT [the Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching] is offering programs and consultations to faculty who themselves feel vulnerable or who are teaching students that may feel that way.\n\nNo one should feel any apprehension about reaching out. People having each other’s backs is where Tufts shines. We’re stronger for having an incredible community that has come together in support of Rümeysa and also our broader international population.\n\nAre these efforts university-wide?\n\nGarson: Schools across Tufts University have support available. As one example, World Peace Foundation and GAIA from the Fletcher School, in partnership with Tisch College, have convened conflict de-escalation workshops. The sessions aimed to give people skill as active bystanders to stay calm and focus on unsafe situations with the expectation of keeping everyone safe. Fletcher also hosted the Massachusetts Refugee and Immigrant Advocacy coalition to update community members on changes in immigration enforcement across the state.\n\nAnd the Provost’s Office has held an information session for community members who may be directly impacted by immigration enforcement actions. There's just a lot being done across Tufts for our international community, all of which we’re amplifying to our audiences.\n\nHow prepared were you to support international students in these ways?\n\nGarson: For our international student and scholars, we have long had an emergency card for guidance in the face of any issues they might experience at their port of entry to the U.S. The protocol for contacting TUPD [Tufts University Police Department] with any questions was a part of that. Now, we’re doing all we can to make certain our community knows that the protocol applies to any type of immigration enforcement action.\n\nWhy is this support so important?\n\nGarson: Our international student, scholar, and employee community is vast, representing more than 125 countries. Many of them graduated at top of their class—or they’re employees who've earned the highest credentials. These are people who have already faced immense challenges to get here. They've left behind their families and friends and communities to come to this country to learn and contribute personally or professionally.\n\nThese are integral members of our community. It’s our duty to make sure they receive support, care, and empathy, alongside the resources—immigration and otherwise--they need to succeed at Tufts. On a broader level, having international students, researchers, faculty and staff is essential. It enriches our campus. Global perspectives and the exchange of ideas not only create more dynamic classrooms but also lead to more prepared and empathetic leaders. We should be preparing and exposing students—both domestic and international students—to varying worldviews and ideas to best prepare them to tackle the challenges of the world.\n\nWhat else do you want the Tufts international community to know?\n\nTalgar: With the density of colleges and universities all around us, Boston remains the very best place for pursuing your educational aspirations. Add to that the support that Massachusetts offers to its citizens. And recognizing that we live at a time when difficult decisions need to be made, Tufts makes those decisions with the interests of its entire community in mind. There’s no other university besides Tufts I’d rather be at right now.",

    "content": "Three Tufts faculty members have been named fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest scientific society. They join 468 other scientists, engineers, and innovators from many scientific disciplines being recognized for their scientific achievements.\n\n“This year’s class of fellows are the embodiment of scientific excellence and service to our communities,” says Sudip S. Parikh, AAAS chief executive officer. “At a time when the future of the scientific enterprise in the U.S. and around the world is uncertain, their work demonstrates the value of sustained investment in science and engineering.”\n\nFounded in 1848, the AAAS publishes Science, Science Translational Medicine, Science Signaling, and other journals. The nonprofit seeks to “advance science and serve society” through initiatives in science policy, international programs, science education, and more.\n\nThis year’s fellows from Tufts are Michael Levin, A92, Vannevar Bush Professor of Biology in the School of Arts and Sciences; Elena Naumova, professor in the Division of Nutrition Epidemiology and Data Science and director of the Tufts Initiative for Forecasting and Modeling of Infectious Diseases (InForMID) in the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy; and Matthias Scheutz, Karol Family Applied Technology Professor in Computer Science and director of the Human-Robot Interaction Lab. They join 17 other current Tufts faculty as fellows of the AAAS.\n\n“We take great pride in our faculty for receiving this prestigious recognition for their research—a testament to their excellence and the distinguished reputation of Tufts,” says Bernard Arulanandam, vice provost for research at Tufts and a 2016 AAAS Fellow.\n\nMichael Levin, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Biology and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts, seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie cell growth and tissue formation, focusing on the role of bioelectricity in the process, with the goal of creating new frontiers of regenerative medicine. Applications include fighting cancer, reversing degenerative diseases, repairing congenital anomalies, and ultimately even regrowing limbs.\n\nHe studies bioelectrical signals, which are part of how cells communicate, and uses machine learning and AI to further understand how organisms grow. “We don’t want to try to tell every cell and every gene what to do,” Levin says. “We’re not looking to teach cells how to grow a leg; we’re looking to convince them that that’s what they should do.”\n\nLevin’s lab created living robots called xenobots from frog embryonic stem cells, and later made what they called anthrobots from human tracheal cells that were found to move across a surface and even encouraged the repair of neurons in a lab dish.\n\n“Bioelectricity is the cognitive glue that binds individual neurons’ activity into a mind. Likewise, it binds other body cells into a collective intelligence that navigates the space of anatomical possibilities,” says Levin. “We are learning to communicate with that intelligence, to rewrite its memories, and thus to control growth and form by collaboration, not micromanagement. Our work impacts not only regenerative medicine but bioengineering, AI, and philosophy of mind.”\n\nElena Naumova focuses her research on emerging and re-emerging diseases, environmental epidemiology, molecular biology, and nutrition. She develops analytical tools for data analysis over time and space, applying it to disease surveillance and exposure assessment.\n\nShe also creates and applies analytical tools to evaluate the influence of extreme events (like natural disasters and pandemics) and intermediate events (like heatwaves and seasonal flu outbreaks) to discover their spatial and temporal patterns and create ways to anticipate future events and minimize their harmful health effects by building resilient communities.\n\nNaumova studies the spread of infections that are sensitive to climate variations and extreme weather events using a wide variety of data sources, including remote sensing data and satellite imagery, seeking to understand the nature and causes of diseases on local and global scales. In 2022, she was named as a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Scientific Advisory Board.\n\n“I am deeply honored to be named a fellow of the AAAS,” says Naumova. “This recognition reflects the collective spirit of my colleagues, students, and staff, whose dedication has made Tufts a place I am proud to call home for nearly 30 years—a community where we strive to nurture curiosity, embrace diverse perspectives, uphold academic freedom, and pursue science with lasting social impact.”\n\nMatthias Scheutz, a professor of computer science and mechanical engineering, focuses on artificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, human-robot interaction, and natural language understanding.\n\nAt the Human-Robot Interaction Lab that Scheutz directs, he and his students are working on developing a complex AI control system for intelligent autonomous robots that can quickly learn new tasks from human instructions and observations. Critically, the lab focuses on imbuing the robots with rudimentary ethical competence that enables them to learn and obey human norms in all of their actions, including social interactions in everyday settings.\n\nOne example of the outcomes of his research is a patent Scheutz received for a system and method for ensuring safe, norm-conforming, and ethical behavior of intelligent systems. The system would generate a clone of a robot’s operating system and run simulated tests of certain behaviors. If the robot passed the norms standards in the testing, it would be allowed to continue operating in the real-world environment. But if it failed the standards test, the system could override the robot’s intended actions or even shut it down.\n\n“Today is more important than ever that we in academia push back against the premature technology deployment we are witnessing with large tech corporations,” says Scheutz. “While artificial intelligence is a powerful tool to improve the human condition, it can also have detrimental effects. We at Tufts have been at the forefront of ethical AI and robotics, and continue to voice our concerns while also providing solutions that are workable, safe and ethical.”",

    "content": "Five Tufts faculty have been named as senior members of the National Academy of Inventors, an honor for academic inventors who are rising leaders in their respective fields and who have produced technologies that seek to bring a positive impact on society.\n\nThe organization recognizes and supports academic inventors and enhances the visibility of academic technology and innovation.\n\n“This year’s class comes from a multitude of impressive fields and research backgrounds from across the world,” says Paul Sanberg, president of the National Academy of Inventors. “We applaud their pursuit of commercialization to ensure their groundbreaking technologies can make a difference by tackling the world’s most pressing issues, improving quality of life across society, and advancing the economy.”\n\nThis year’s senior members from Tufts are Ira Herman, Valencia Koomson, Nikhil Nair, Igor Sokolov, and Sameer Sonkusale. They will be inducted at the NAI annual meeting in June in Atlanta.\n\n“This honor highlights the innovative research being done by our faculty, and the wide-ranging impacts that it has in so many areas,” says Bernard Arulanandam, vice provost for research at Tufts. “Through the groundbreaking research, our new NAI senior members have pioneered innovations in healing wounds, assessing health, treating rare disorders, detecting diseases, quantifying pain, and unlocking countless other advancements in the world of medicine.”\n\nIra Herman, professor emeritus in the Department of Developmental, Molecular, and Chemical Biology in the Graduate School of Biomedical Science, is a leader in wound care, regenerative medicine, and the underpinnings of tissue repair. His discoveries and innovations have led to advanced non-invasive diagnostics for assessing wound state and healing trajectory. His insights into patient care for hard-to-heal wounds are expected to significantly impact treatment methods, potentially preventing limb and life loss.\n\nThe holder of 12 U.S. patents, Herman and his collaborators created a new class of therapeutic peptides that represent promise for multiple indications regardless of wound type, including scarless wound healing, the mitigation or prevention of radiation-induced dermatitis, hair growth, and scalable skin grafting devices capable of restoring thermally injured skin. An active, funded emeritus faculty member, Herman has been at the center of the creation of several biotech companies in wound diagnostics, therapeutics, and value-based wound care.\n\nValencia Koomson, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering in the School of Engineering, conducts research at the intersection of biology, medicine, and electrical engineering. The founding director of the Advanced Integrated Circuits and Systems Lab, she conducts pioneering work on micro- and nano-scale electronic circuits, wearables, and health informatics.\n\nShe has particularly focused on addressing health disparities in pulse oximetry, used for blood oxygen assessment, seeking to ensure that pulse oximeters provide reliable, high-precision readings, especially for patients of color. Pulse oximeters are one of the most widely used medical devices in the world to measure blood oxygen levels. Koomson, who holds two U.S. utility patents, is founder of a medical device company seeking to commercialize the oximetry sensor technology developed in her lab.\n\nNikhil Nair, an associate professor of chemical and biological engineering in the School of Engineering, leads research on basic and applied microbial synthetic and systems biology. His work focuses primarily on altering aspects of microbial physiology, aiming to engineer them for applications related to human health and sustainability.\n\nNair’s research spans several areas, including engineering phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme variants to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder; discovering and characterizing a novel protein in Bacillus subtilis spores that can be used for enzyme immobilization, which enables biocatalysis for biomass conversion and renewable chemical biosynthesis; and developing a bioengineered yeast that can feed on a wide range of feedstocks for biofuel production.\n\nIgor Sokolov, a professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering, has wide-ranging research interests, from material synthesis and the physics of cancer and aging to the development of new instrumentation, photonic nanomaterials, atomic force microscopy, and machine learning. His pioneering research has advanced the fields of material science and biomedical engineering, with a particular focus on imaging nanoscale material properties and non-invasive, disease detection.\n\nWith more than 20 issued and pending U.S. patents, Sokolov has founded six startups, including Cellens with former Tufts graduate student Jean Pham, EG21, where they are developing pioneering diagnostic tests for bladder cancer using multiparametric, single-cell biophysical markers combined with machine learning for noninvasive early detection.\n\nSameer Sonkusale, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, with joint appointments in biomedical engineering and chemical and biological engineering, does research in bioelectronics, biomedical devices, and nanoscale sensors. His work spans from point-of-care diagnostics and lab-on-chip micro-systems to analog and mixed-signal computing and brain-inspired machine learning.\n\nSonkusale, who has been awarded 10 U.S. utility patents and has more than 30 pending patents, has developed smart bandages, new methods of quantifying pain, flexible thread-based sensors that can measure movement, microneedles used for low-cost, pain free injections, and a microneedle-based drug delivery system. His team also invented the world’s first microbiome sampling capsule capable of passively sampling from different regions of the gastrointestinal tract, including the small intestine.",

    "content": "Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:\n\nI am writing to you with an important update about our international community. Over the past several days, we have learned that the federal government has terminated the F-1 visas of at least seven Ohio State international students. We were not formally notified of these actions by the government, nor have we received any information about why the students’ visas were revoked.\n\nCaring for our students is our highest priority, and we have been in contact with all seven students to offer resources and support. Multiple offices across our university, including the Office of Academic Affairs, Legal Affairs, International Affairs, Student Life and Human Resources, are coordinating to best assist each student and provide the full scale of resources available to them. In addition, Student Legal Services is providing independent legal advice upon request.\n\nI know these developments have created deep concern and uncertainty among many in our community. While we recognize that visa decisions are the authority of the U.S. government and Ohio State plays no role in these decisions, I share a strong desire for clarity around these actions. Ohio State, after all, has long been – and will continue to be – proud to welcome students from all over the world, who add greatly to the life of our campuses and community. International students, visiting scholars and staff enrich the Ohio State experience for all, and we are a stronger university for their presence and contributions.\n\nOhio State is not alone in navigating this new uncertainty. Many other universities across the country have recently learned of similar actions regarding international students on their campuses. We are in regular communication with our peers about these developments and potential next steps. Our national associations, led by the American Council on Education, have also requested more details from the federal government and we are awaiting a response.\n\nAs I shared in my campus message on February 12, our teams are actively monitoring policy developments at all levels of government. Ohio State plays a vital role in the overall success and competitiveness of our state, and we will continue our work to advance policies that support our life-saving research and an affordable and high-quality university. We have put together detailed guidance for students, faculty and staff who may have questions. I encourage you to review the webpage for information on legislative and executive actions.\n\nAnd, as always, I ask you to continue to show grace and compassion to each other. Our care for one another during changing and uncertain moments can be a model to others, and I am proud to be part of the Buckeye community.\n\nThank you for all you do to make Ohio State a better place.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTed Carter\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:\n\nAs we shared with you earlier this month, our university has been working carefully to review policy developments at all levels of government, including a review of the work we do in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Our goal is to ensure that Ohio State continues to be a place where all are welcomed and treated with respect, while following the letter and spirit of the laws and regulations that govern us.\n\nSince I last wrote to you, we have seen a number of developments at both the state and federal levels regarding DEI in public education. The federal government has signaled its intent to enforce guidance invalidating the use of race in a broad range of educational activities, including by withdrawing federal dollars that are so important to our student, academic and operational success. Here in Ohio, a bill barring DEI is also making its way through the legislature, and the Attorney General of Ohio – our statutory counsel – has advised us that his office concurs with the federal government’s position regarding the use of race in educational activities.\n\nThis is a complex and rapidly changing environment, involving multiple court cases at various stages in the legal process. We can’t predict the outcome of any one legal case, but what we do know is this: Taken together, the actions at the state and federal levels and the guidance we’ve received from our state and federal leaders provide a clear signal that we will need to make changes now in the way we have historically gone about our work in DEI.\n\nThese are difficult conversations, as we knew they would be. All of higher education is facing a challenging environment. Nonetheless, I continue to believe that the best course for our university is to take actions proactively so that we can manage this new landscape in ways that best uphold the values of excellence, access and opportunity that we hold dear.\n\nToday I want to let you know that we are taking the following initial steps:\n\nWe will sunset the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) along with some of its services, effective February 28, 2025. Scholarships administered by the Office of Academic Affairs, including the Morrill Scholarship Program and the Young Scholars Program will be maintained with modified eligibility criteria going forward.\n\nThe programming and services offered by Student Life’s Center for Belonging and Social Change (CBSC) will be discontinued effective February 28, 2025.\n\nThe Office of Institutional Equity will be renamed the Office of Civil Rights Compliance to more accurately reflect its work and will report solely to the Office of University Compliance and Integrity. The Office of Civil Rights Compliance will continue to serve as a university-wide resource for receiving, investigating and resolving all reports of discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct.\n\nI want to note that these changes will not impact current student scholarships, financial aid or student employment. Selection criteria for existing scholarships connected with these programs may be modified if necessary to ensure compliance with the law, but every current student who has earned an award will retain their scholarship. Some services will remain and be transitioned into other areas within Academic Affairs or Student Life, and staff in those areas will remain with Ohio State.\n\nFor impacted staff who are connected to programs that are being discontinued, we will follow our usual practice of working with those individuals to find other opportunities at Ohio State where possible. All student employees impacted by the program changes will be offered alternative jobs at the university. The university is communicating directly to impacted staff, students and faculty to provide further details.\n\nBoth ODI and the CBSC have historically done valuable work for our campus and students. I know these decisions will be disappointing for many in our community, particularly as we navigate an already uncertain and challenging period. We may not know all the answers, but I have heard your concerns, I understand the varied emotions many on our campus are feeling, and I have been heartened to witness the grace and care with which we are treating each other in uncertain moments.\n\nI am particularly grateful to the many colleagues who have been working under an accelerated timeline to make the best decisions we can for our university with the rapidly changing information we have in front of us. We will share more information as our work goes along. As decisions are made, information about services and programs will be removed or changed across university websites, social media and materials.\n\nOhio State has always been a place where every member of our community matters, where each of us is seen and heard, and where we all have opportunities to succeed. Protecting all our students, faculty and staff so that they can all be successful in their time at Ohio State will remain our North Star. We will continue to celebrate the richness of backgrounds and ideas that makes us strong, and to uphold the time-honored value of academic freedom that has long defined the excellence of America’s universities.\n\nI have great resolve about our ability to navigate these challenges together. Most importantly, I am grateful that each of you is part of the Ohio State community. Thank you for all you do.\n\nTed Carter\n\nPresident\n\nThe Ohio State University",

    "content": "Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:\n\n\n\nOver the past several weeks, those of us in higher education have found ourselves at the center of a number of vigorous debates at both the state and national levels. We have heard from many of you with questions about how the ongoing policy discussions could impact the important work of our university. Today we are writing to share an update.\n\n\n\nFirst, our teams are actively monitoring policy developments at all levels of government. Ohio State plays a vital role in the overall success and competitiveness of our state, and we will continue our work to advance policies that support our life-saving research and an affordable and high-quality university. We have created a website that will serve as a central resource for all information on legislative and executive actions and their potential impact on Ohio State. We invite you to check back regularly for updates and new information.\n\n\n\nSecond, we are continuing our ongoing evaluation of our university’s work in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and are forming working groups to review Ohio State jobs and duties related to DEI and to examine our DEI programming, initiatives and projects. Our goal is to ensure that we have a full picture of the university’s work in this area and can be positioned to make changes if state or federal law requires it or if we decide a different approach is in the university’s best interests.\n\n\n\nThese conversations can be difficult, particularly on a campus like ours where diversity of background and ideas is at the very heart of our mission. Indeed, land-grant universities were created on the ideal that the promise of higher education should be open to all. In our view, that mission is more important today than ever. As we pursue excellence together, we remain committed to our goal to make Ohio State a university where all are welcomed, safe and free to debate and share diverse ideas. Assuring opportunity for all members of our community has always mattered here, and that’s not changing.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, we believe it’s appropriate to be proactive given the policy discussions happening around us. As a public institution, we will always follow the laws and regulations that govern us. Changes are almost certainly on the horizon, and the best way to manage change is to be prepared. The proactive steps we are taking now will best position us to continue our work uninterrupted in ensuring that students, faculty and staff of all backgrounds can be successful at Ohio State.\n\n\n\nAs the working groups move forward, we will be transparent and will share updates on any policy developments as information becomes available.\n\n\n\nAs always, thank you for the exceptional work you do every day in teaching, learning, research and patient care.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nWalter “Ted” Carter Jr.\n\nPresident\n\n\n\nRavi V. Bellamkonda, PhD\n\nExecutive Vice President and Provost\n\n\n\nPeter Mohler, PhD\n\nExecutive Vice President for Research, Innovation and Knowledge\n\n\n\nJohn J.

This project has been steadily progressing throughout this semester, and I am grateful to the many staff and faculty colleagues who have dedicated their time and efforts to ensuring a smooth and thoughtful process for all throughout this period.\n\nAs we continue to make progress, we have migrated the current webpage Enhancing Our Academic Vision to Guru in order to provide detailed information there that is specific to faculty and staff. It will serve as our primary hub for information about this work and I encourage you to visit the page regularly for the latest updates and information. We will continue to keep this Guru card up-to-date for everyone’s reference.\n\nWe are also pleased to share this FAQ document that we have prepared in response to questions received from the community. Hopefully it will serve as a helpful resource, but feel free to reach out to provost@newschool.edu with any further questions or concerns related to the work ahead. Additional updates to SPE students are scheduled to be sent this week.\n\nWe have made progress and our next steps will continue to move this important work forward over the course of the next academic year. As always, I will continue to provide timely and transparent updates to the community about these academic shifts and appreciate all that you do for our university.",

Faculty participation has been central to these efforts, which are helping to shape a broader, long-term culture of assessment at all levels of our institution.\n\nA key milestone was The New School Promise: A Forum on Teaching, Assessment, and Accountability, held on March 27. If you missed it, you can view the 40-minute recording and slides here. Featuring Ashley Finley, the event emphasized the vital role of assessment in shaping student learning, with insights from AAC&U’s VALUE rubrics and national employer data—both aligned with areas where our students already demonstrate strength. Well attended, it brought together a wide range of colleagues, including part-time and full-time faculty and staff, to reflect on teaching, learning, and how we define and measure student achievement. These conversations will directly inform future assessment planning. Faculty and staff who are interested in partnering in this work are encouraged to complete this brief survey.\n\n‌We’ve also completed the first phase of our Middle States response, with 100% of programs and certificates submitting curriculum maps. The second phase—focused on each program assessing one program learning outcome—is now underway. Support will continue through workshops and faculty engagement opportunities. In partnership with the colleges, we are working at the institutional level to develop systematic and comprehensive long-term plans for assessing student learning across both academic and non-academic units.\n\nFinally, acknowledging other assessment and accreditation efforts at The New School, we’d like to recognize the successful completion of the NAAB accreditation for the Master of Architecture program at Parsons. Many thanks to the faculty and staff whose efforts made this possible.\n\nWe look forward to building on this momentum together.",

White, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nDear New School Community,\n\nI am thrilled to share the winners of 2025 Spark Awards—a new part of our annual Spark celebration honoring the bold achievements, creative energy, and collaborative spirit that define The New School.\n\nIn our inaugural year, we received over 180 Spark Award submissions from all areas of the university, and our Award Selection Committee, comprised of students, faculty, staff, and alumni, had the challenging task of narrowing down these truly thoughtful and incredible nominations to just eight individuals or teams.\n\nThe Awards were designed to recognize university members whose research, work, creativity, and passion lights the way for others—whether through groundbreaking projects, boundary-pushing ideas, or the everyday acts of care and connection that strengthen our community.\n\nOur 2025 Award recipients exemplify what it means to spark change, inspire others, and embody the progressive values at the heart of The New School.\n\nTo honor this year’s recipients and celebrate our remarkable community, we hope you’ll join us tomorrow, April 16 at the Spark Reception. Enjoy snacks and refreshments, connect with community members from across the university, and raise a toast to the achievements that make The New School an engaging hub of creativity and intellectual rigor.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating:\n\n‌ The All for NarWELL Team: Since its inception, the All for NarWELL initiative—led by the Center for Global Mental Health and funded by a GLS SAMHSA Grant—has been dedicated to enhancing campus-wide suicide intervention efforts and mental health awareness programs. Working in collaboration with key partners, the initiative has trained over 500 individuals in suicide prevention strategies as well as over 200 in Psychological First Aid. To further support student well-being, platforms such as Togetherall and MindWise Innovation Screening & Training have been integrated into campus resources. Preliminary data indicates that these tools are effectively reaching vulnerable populations who might otherwise hesitate to seek help.\n\nSince its inception, the initiative—led by the and funded by a GLS SAMHSA Grant—has been dedicated to enhancing campus-wide suicide intervention efforts and mental health awareness programs.

The Food Pantry Team: An essential resource for The New School community, the Food Pantry allows many students to continue their studies and university involvement by reducing food insecurity. Managed largely by students for students, it has become a well-known resource and space for students to access not only for their food needs but to connect socially. The support of foundational needs like The Pantry are critical to successful efforts in every other dimension of The New School community.\n\nAn essential resource for The New School community, the Food Pantry allows many students to continue their studies and university involvement by reducing food insecurity.

Staff & Part-Time Parsons faculty members Molly Davy and Shannon Finnell (MFA Photography ’18) are spearheading Parsons Staff Art Show, to be on view in Fall ‘25 at the Aronson and Kellen galleries. The work of staff can often feel more hidden than that of faculty, students, and even alumni, and can at times get overlooked within the context of our campus community’s year-to-year activities and focus. Their efforts to lift up and showcase administrative staff as whole individuals, beyond their jobs, is the biggest and most far-reaching effort of its kind to take place at Parsons in recent memory. Taking on this initiative outside the purview of their administrative roles, while tapping into their expertise as curators themselves, sets a new precedent for staff recognition across the university.\n\nare spearheading Parsons Staff Art Show, to be on view in Fall ‘25 at the Aronson and Kellen galleries.

Spitting Image Art Book Fair is The New School’s first community exhibition and tabling event for print media. Launched in Fall ’23 and student-run, it has borne a beautiful community of book artists, chapbook makers, and print aficionados across campus, gifting many with their first opportunity to exhibit their work in a public setting. The team’s passion for the project is palpable. In its exhibition efforts, Spitting Image has facilitated and presented the contemporary presence of the book arts amongst our student body, which connects outwardly to NYC’s generation’s-old print and DIY scene. Spitting Image continues to connect its students to other opportunities in the arts by programming its exhibition with guest speakers that are truly engaged professionals in arts publishing and community organizing. It is funded by university opportunities like the Provost’s Investment Fund and Lang College’s Community Events grant. Its organizers have also allocated funds to make this event accessible for students to participate in and free of charge for external visitors. It creates a platform for art exhibitions, cultural engagement, and community building.\n\nis The New School’s first community exhibition and tabling event for print media.

The Team at UnderstandingFAFSA.org is proud to offer how-to instruction, service, and breaking news for families and counselors who need help with an often byzantine financial aid process. The website is best known for its popular book, Understanding FAFSA and Financial Aid: Your Guide to Paying for College. The NYC DOE has been a longtime partner, translating the guide into ten languages, printing it, and distributing it to all high school seniors and their families in their home language. This project has always been run on passion and a shoestring budget, which is why The New School’s name and its ability to inspire a cadre of committed creatives has been so important. UnderstandingFAFSA.org benefits from the pure passion of artistic souls who care about college. But it is the student’s work that has powered this project and made it truly special.\n\n‌Thank you to everyone who submitted nominations and helped bring attention to the extraordinary efforts happening across our community.",

White, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nI am pleased to announce that Cynthia Lawson Jaramillo has been appointed as the new Vice Provost for Research in the Provost’s Office, succeeding Adam Brown. In this role, Cynthia will support and guide the university’s research mission and strategy, enhance its internal and external visibility, and ensure that the values and human protections that inform the university’s research enterprise are embodied throughout the university. Working in close partnership with the Associate Provost for Research, Cheryl Green, she will co-lead the University Research Council, provide strategic grant application support, and protect the safety and welfare of employees and research participants, among other responsibilities. Through the formulation and implementation of policies, procedures, systems, and educational programs that aim to strengthen research and related activities, Cynthia will support high quality research initiatives and help to ensure the excellence and integrity of all aspects of the research process.\n\nCynthia Lawson Jaramillo (she/her/ella) is Professor of Integrated Design at Parsons School of Design, a practitioner and scholar of social design and design education, and an internationally exhibited artist. Since joining The New School in 2003, she has held several leadership roles including as Dean of the School of Design Strategies (2020-24) and Associate Provost for Distributed and Global Education (2012-17). Cynthia serves as Associate Editor of the Journal of Design Strategies, and is an active member of the design education networks of AIGA, Future of Design in Higher Education, and DEL Conference, for which she serves on the committee. As a consultant Cynthia has worked internationally with organizations such as CARE and the World Bank.\n\nA Fulbright scholar, her work on interdisciplinary design education, design and social impact, and the ethics of community engagement has appeared in several peer-reviewed journals, including Visible Language and Dialectic; and as book chapters, including in publications by MIT Press and Routledge. The DEED Lab, which Cynthia co-founded in 2007 and currently directs, is known globally for its research on the artisan sector – especially critiquing the role designers and entrepreneurs play in contributing to extracting money and value from craft communities. Her artwork centered around themes of time and transience and award-winning digital poetry (with S. Strickland) have been exhibited and performed across the Americas and Europe, including at The Kitchen and HERE Arts Center in New York City, UCLA Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, Point Éphémère in Paris, and the Museums of Modern Art in Bogotá and Medellín, Colombia.\n\n‌Please join me in congratulating Cynthia and welcoming her to her new role in the Provost’s Office.",

White, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nWe want to follow up on the statement of commitment sent to you earlier this week.\n\nWe are grateful to the students, faculty, and staff who reached out to share their thoughts. Some let us know that we were not direct enough in expressing support for those in our community who are transgender, non-binary, or identify as LGBTQ+.\n\nWe want to share our unequivocal assurances that The New School stands firm in support of the rich and beautiful diversity of opinion and people on our campus, and our commitment to the pursuit of knowledge, protection of academic freedom, and the university’s teaching and learning mission.\n\nAt The New School, we draw strength from our extraordinary diversity—of backgrounds, viewpoints, orientations, experiences and identities—and many in our community feel especially vulnerable. Our country is experiencing a new level of discord, and it seems that almost every day there is a new development that threatens the core values of inclusion and openness exemplified by The New School. This includes directives by the Trump administration that directly target transgender and non-binary individuals. It’s also clear that we must prepare for the possibility that future directives and policies may target other members of our community.\n\nWe must remain attuned to this and support those who are hurting and frightened. It is crucial that we continue to assert our commitment to nurturing a diverse, inclusive, and supportive environment and embrace efforts to create positive change. No matter what may happen in the days and weeks ahead, we must stand together because no one should ever be unsafe, unheard, or disempowered because of who they are or who they love.\n\nThe university has been engaged in an ongoing review and update of our policies and practices encompassing our pedagogy, scholarship, culture, and engagement with the outside world. Out of these conversations, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our efforts to ensure that all members of our community—regardless of their identity or beliefs—feel valued, respected, and appreciated. These include enhanced gender affirming care benefits for faculty and staff and expanded gender affirming benefits for students through the university’s Student Health Insurance Plan. You can learn more about our LGBTQ+ community, resources, and support on our website. Looking ahead, the university will convene open forums to explore how new federal policies related to gender identity, immigration, and other key issues impact our community; hold trainings and table top exercises to prepare the community on how to respond to emergent challenges; and look to further build out our existing scholarship and support structures.\n\nOur university thrives because of our diversity—we see the humanity and dignity in every member of our community. Your experiences, contributions, voices, and perspectives enrich our campus in immeasurable ways. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to the values that infuse our legacy and inform our work today.",

    "content": "Announcing Leadership Changes in the Provost’s Office\n\nA Message from Dr. Renée T. White, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nI am pleased to announce some recent leadership changes within the Provost’s Office that will enhance our efforts and help to ensure robust support, communication, and coordination across different areas.\n\nIn recognition of her outstanding leadership and demonstrated commitment to academic excellence and success at The New School, Maggie Koozer has been promoted to Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, with oversight of the areas of Curriculum, Learning and Academic Affairs (CLAA) and Faculty Affairs units. These two areas of the Provost’s Office, which currently work closely together, have now been formally brought together under the same leadership umbrella. In her new position, Maggie will assume a lead role in implementing strategic goals and objectives related to academic programming and initiatives, serving as a partner to the deans, institutional leaders, and university committees. A member of the Provost’s Senior Leadership Team and Deputy Academic Officer, she will continue to provide leadership, vision, and coordination across all areas of academic affairs at The New School while working to foster collaboration, build connections, and create and facilitate new approaches to enhancing faculty recruitment and retention success. Along with her depth of experience, Maggie brings with her a great spirit of creativity and collegiality and I look forward to continuing our partnership in this important work.\n\nAfter serving in the role for four years, Michael Schober has stepped down as Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs. During his tenure, Michael has done much to advance the work of faculty affairs at The New School while also navigating the challenges of the pandemic and several leadership transitions, always centering equity and faculty development and support. He has worked to clarify and streamline full-time faculty review practices and to integrate full- and part-time faculty processes within the Provost’s Office. He has chaired or co-chaired several committees, including serving as tri-chair of the Middle States Self-Study Re-accreditation Steering Committee and as chair of the Provost’s Office Faculty Affairs Committee, and he has overseen the Libraries, Collections, and Academic Services, the Office of Research Support (ORS), and Faculty Development, as well as serving as a primary liaison for several of the university’s research institutes, among many other responsibilities. Michael brings a service-oriented approach to his work and has closely collaborated with the University Faculty Senate on initiatives that prioritize faculty wellbeing, elevate faculty work, and promote shared governance. As Michael transitions away to an exciting new project—serving as a half-time Senior Research Fellow at the US Census Bureau for two years, under the provisions of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act—and returns to the faculty, he has graciously agreed to serve in an interim part-time capacity as Senior Advisor to the Provost for Faculty Affairs for the spring semester. In this capacity, he will focus on a number of discrete projects, including serving as a strategic advisor for all faculty policies, issues, and initiatives and continued leadership of ORS as we close out the search for the next Vice Provost for Research and work to hire a new Assistant Director of Research & Compliance Administration.\n\nI am also pleased to announce that we are launching a search to fill the new position of Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs, a reimagining of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs position that will report to the Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs. This full-time role is open to full-time faculty members appointed at the associate or full professor level, and is responsible for leading and overseeing key areas related to full- and part-time faculty, including full-time faculty searches, reviews for reappointment and promotion for full-time faculty and part-time faculty applying for multi-year status, compliance with collective bargaining agreements, development and implementation of policies and procedures that impact full- and part-time faculty, and support for faculty in professional development. We encourage eligible faculty members to read more about the position and consider applying at the link below. You may also submit nominations for the role by emailing provost@newschool.edu.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Maggie to her new role and in thanking Michael for his significant contributions to the Provost’s Office over the years.",

    "content": "Supporting Our Community\n\nA Message from Joel Towers, President and University Professor; and Renée T. White, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nWe want to address the uncertainty surrounding recent Executive Orders and directives by President Trump and their potential impact on The New School. We recognize that these developments have fueled questions and confusion on a number of issues that directly affect our community—from immigration policies to freezing federal funding for public and private institutions. We want to take this opportunity to update you on the steps the university is taking to protect international and undocumented members of our community, students receiving federal financial aid, and ensure that federally funded research continues.\n\nAs leaders of an institution of higher education, we are deeply concerned by the actions and rhetoric of the new administration. Our university remains unwavering in its commitment to provide an open, safe, and inclusive academic environment to a globally diverse community of students, faculty and staff. They infuse our campus with a wide range of cultural, political, ethnic, racial, and religious perspectives that add immeasurably to our scholarship, creativity, and ability to engage effectively with complex global issues.\n\nSupporting International and Undocumented Members of our Community\n\nIt is, and has been, our policy to welcome, admit, and support students without regard to their citizenship status.\n\nWe steadfastly protect the privacy rights of all our students, faculty, and staff.\n\nWe do not release records in our possession that may disclose citizenship status to any law enforcement authority, absent a court order or legally enforceable subpoena.\n\nThe New School does not permit law enforcement authorities, absent a court order, legally issued warrant, or other legal mandate, to enter university buildings for the purpose of detaining any student, staff member, or faculty member solely based on immigration status for the purpose of possible deportation.\n\nIf our existing policies prove insufficient to protect the university mission and our community, we will pursue additional measures on our own and in collaboration with other universities.\n\nUpdate on Federal Funding Freeze\n\nOn Monday, the White House Office of Management and Budget announced a freeze on federal grants and loans in a memorandum titled “Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs.” Despite a federal injunction late last night that temporarily blocks the freeze, we are working quickly to create plans to minimize disruptions for our university community.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has clarified that the freeze does not apply to Title IV federal financial aid programs that are provided to individual students, such as Federal Pell Grants and Direct Loans. We will continue to monitor new information and respond accordingly to support our students.\n\nThe outlook is uncertain regarding federal funding for research. We are working quickly to review additional information and assess potential implications for New School research projects and teams. Research leads will be receiving more specific guidance on how they should proceed.\n\nLet us be clear: Amid the dynamics in Washington, D.C., The New School remains committed to upholding our academic mission and the values of diversity, inclusiveness, openness, and critical scholarly inquiry that are inherent in a strong university culture.\n\nUniversity Resources and Support\n\nWe will continue to support our community in every way we can—from access to support and resources to collective advocacy to oppose actions that threaten higher education and programming to help our community stay abreast of the issues. Many members of the university community are working in different ways to address aspects of these issues and how they connect to our academic mission. These include:\n\nEstablishing a cross-functional university working group charged with gathering information and making recommendations to help our community navigate these issues.\n\nDirect outreach by our International Student and Scholar Services team with students to let them know the team is available to answer questions and offer guidance.\n\nSupport and guidance from Office of Research Support staff that is relevant to awarded and in-process federal grants.\n\nAnd outreach by our admission team to prospective international students and their families to offer reassurance that we remain committed to global diversity and inclusiveness.\n\nThis is a dynamic, evolving situation, and the scope and impact of the Executive Orders and directives continue to unfold. We hope you will carefully review the list of resources below. Please look for updates as we become aware of any new information or significant changes.\n\nOur values as a community are more important than ever, and we encourage you to remain steadfast in your support of those ideals and your fellow New Schoolers.\n\nResources for Students\n\nInternational Student and Scholar Services (ISSS): ISSS advising staff are available to offer support and discuss student concerns.

    "content": "Welcome Back and Looking Ahead to the Spring Semester\n\nA Message from Dr. Renée T. White, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nDear Students, Faculty, and Staff,\n\nI am excited to welcome everyone back to campus for the start of the spring semester. As we enter a new year, I hope that everyone is returning from the winter break feeling refreshed and inspired, ready to dive back into ongoing work and embark on new projects.\n\nWhile the year is young, it has already presented us with significant challenges. In particular, I would like to hold space here for those among us who have been impacted by the ongoing devastation of the wildfires across Los Angeles. Student Success and Admission staff have been in regular contact with current and prospective students directly affected by these fires, and will continue this outreach. Please know that we are here to offer our support to those who need it. At the bottom of this email you will find a list of available resources. This week also saw the inauguration of a new presidential administration, which is already posing threats to democratic norms, citizenship and immigrant rights, gender identity, trans rights, DEI programs, and the environment, among others. Already vulnerable communities are even more precarious now, and are understandably worried for their safety as legislative and policy protections are dismantled. Be assured that we remain steadfast in our commitment to all members of our campus community. The urgent need to uphold and preserve democracy and to stand firm in our commitment to diversity and academic freedom are among the most significant duties of our time, and speak to the importance, now more than ever, of the mission and values of The New School and the need to continue our collective efforts to make the world a better and more just place.\n\nLast night I had the good fortune to listen to Nikole Hannah-Jones speak at the annual meeting of the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U). She was clear-eyed, pragmatic, and brutally honest about the successes and failures of higher ed leaders. Among her many insights, she commented on the slow erosion of faith and investment in education as a public good, noting that we are at another moment where it is essential to act decisively and with purpose in defense of basic principles of democracy. She further remarked on the importance of higher education institutions continuing what our charge is – to be spaces of inquiry and discovery, places that educate and produce knowledge. The thing we do best is also what some people fear – that we graduate adults who are independent and critical thinkers, concerned about the world, and oriented to betterment for all. With that in mind, I would like to turn to the work we do and offer examples of how we intend to be true to our educational charge.\n\nThere is indeed so much great work happening across campus. At the start of the academic year, I was so pleased to launch the Provost’s Investment Fund, an initiative designed to foster collaboration and innovation across the university by nurturing programs that enhance our campus culture, promote interdisciplinary connections, and support equity, inclusion, social justice, and belonging. The first call funded 20 proposals across three areas: Culture of Care, EISJ Praxis, and Public Programs, with $120,000 to be awarded this pilot year. The projects funded include student-run initiatives such as the Spitting Image Art Fair, faculty research on pedagogy of care, and support for a mixed cohort of staff, faculty, and students to attend the NCORE conference, a key forum for promoting access, education, and cross-cultural understanding. The second round of funding will close on February 1 and you can apply here.\n\nWe also formally welcome this semester our scholar-in-residence Edisa Weeks, a choreographer and educator who joins us as part of programming for The Moment is Now: In Dialogue with Changemakers. More information will be shared soon about the various events and workshops she will be hosting on campus. The new Pedagogy as Praxis series will continue with three events this semester, starting with a conversation on “The Expanse of Radical Arts” on February 5. Organized by Gabrielle Williams, Assistant Professor of Literary Studies and Provost Faculty Fellow, this series invites guests to be in conversation with New School faculty to explore liberatory education, critical pedagogy, and new and transformative ways of teaching and learning as a collective.\n\nThe importance of community is paramount and the Provost’s Office continues to seek out new opportunities to build connections, spark new ideas, and lift each other up. This spring we will host our second annual Spark celebration, created to shine a spotlight on our community’s compelling and wide-ranging work, projects, and activities. As part of this upcoming celebration, we have launched the Spark Awards, a university-wide honor recognizing students, alumni, faculty, and staff who embody the bold, creative, and collaborative spirit that defines The New School. These awards celebrate those who inspire us with their ideas, innovation, and impact, and you can submit a nomination for the award until February 21. I will also continue to host my reading group focused on issues of equity, inclusion, and social justice in higher education, understood through the lens of Black scholars who emphasize the importance of community, empathy, and love in their work. The first session will take place on February 20 and you can sign up here.\n\nIn keeping with cultivating the spirit and power of the collective, I welcome your ideas and input and invite you to connect with the Provost’s Office to let us know how you are doing this semester. We would love to hear what you are looking forward to most this year in your work, studies, and scholarship here at The New School and how we can best support you. You are always welcome to reach out to us at provost@newschool.edu with questions, thoughts, and feedback.\n\nYou can also visit the Provost’s Office Events Hub to learn more about our initiatives and engagement opportunities. In addition to the events the Provost’s Office hosts throughout the year, I welcome opportunities to join you at your meetings and events on campus. Visit the Provost Engagement Request Form to invite me to an upcoming symposium, conversation, or reception.\n\nWe will continue to pay close attention to what is happening in Washington, DC and around the country and to offer support for our community. In addition to the resources listed below, we will be looking at other ways to handle the impacts of the legislative changes happening under this new administration. In the meantime, I wish you all a peaceful start to the semester.\n\n***\n\nSupporting Students, Faculty, and Staff\n\nResources for Students\n\n‌Student Success‌\n\n‌Staff within Student Success are available to help you and your family navigate and access an array of resources.

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nYesterday, the federal government announced that it has revoked Harvard’s certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and stripped the University of its authority to sponsor F- and J- visas for international students and scholars for the 2025-26 academic year. The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government’s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body.\n\n\n\nWe condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams. We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow. As we pursue legal remedies, we will do everything in our power to support our students and scholars. The Harvard International Office will provide periodic updates as new information becomes available.\n\n\n\nThe government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard’s failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security. In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department’s requests as required by law.\n\n\n\nFor those international students and scholars affected by yesterday’s action, know that you are vital members of our community. You are our classmates and friends, our colleagues and mentors, our partners in the work of this great institution. Thanks to you, we know more and understand more, and our country and our world are more enlightened and more resilient. We will support you as we do our utmost to ensure that Harvard remains open to the world.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber",

A hearing has been set for next Thursday, May 29, to determine whether the temporary order should be extended.\n\n\n\nThis is a critical step to protect the rights and opportunities of our international students and scholars, who are vital to the University’s mission and community. Many among us are likely to have additional concerns and questions. Important updates and guidance will continue to be provided by the Harvard International Office as they become available.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber",

    "content": "Dear members of the Columbia community:\n\nLast night, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, announced that they had determined that Columbia had violated Title VI in connection with our actions in response to harassment of Jewish students since October 7, 2023.\n\nI want our community to understand the facts regarding this finding. The announcement is part of the ongoing Title VI investigations into the University. The finding is part of the process to resolve these investigations and seek a restoration of our vital research funding. While we disagree with the government’s conclusion, we are continuing to engage in a thoughtful and constructive manner in addressing these serious issues. It is not a signal that we are no longer working to resolve the issues with regard to our critical and long-standing partnership with the federal government.\n\nTo be clear: Columbia must be a place where everyone feels safe, supported, and respected. The toll antisemitism has taken on individuals in our community is something I’ve witnessed personally, and it is devastating.\n\nWe are deeply devoted to combatting antisemitism and all forms of hate on our campus. This has included increasing security near Jewish student spaces, expanding support services, streamlining disciplinary processes to respond swiftly to violations of our Rules of University Conduct, and creating opportunities for open, respectful engagement among different points of view. More detail about our efforts can be found here.\n\nOur mission, as an educational institution, must begin with a recommitment to respect, empathy, and understanding. Freedom of expression and academic inquiry are also essential to university life. But when speech or conduct becomes hateful, discriminatory, or threatening, we will act firmly and in accordance with our values and our policies. As we move forward in our discussions with the government, we will continue to explore all strategies as we do the important work of addressing these serious issues.\n\nWe know we can do better, and we will.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaire Shipman\n\nActing President, Columbia University in the City of New York",

    "content": "To All Members of the Yale Community,\n\nEarlier today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation that proposes to raise the tax on the investment income of Yale and a number of other universities from 1.4% to 21%. Each year, this increased endowment tax would strip from Yale’s budget hundreds of millions of dollars that currently fund financial aid, research, scholarship, and teaching.\n\nThis legislation presents a greater threat to Yale than any other bill in memory. Today, I ask you to join me in defending the research that saves lives and keeps America competitive, the faculty who enrich minds and help us make sense of our complex world, and the students who keep our future bright. What is at stake is Yale’s ability to offer financial aid, to contribute to the vitality of our nation’s culture and civic life, and to introduce discoveries and innovations that transform the world.\n\nYale is fortunate to have a large endowment, which contributes one-third of the university’s total revenue, and nearly two-thirds of the revenue outside of the medical school. The endowment is the single largest source of revenue for Yale and is far greater than tuition. It enables Yale to provide, this year alone, $564 million in financial aid for students across all schools, $432 million for life-saving and groundbreaking research, and $415 million for faculty teaching and salaries in the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences. It enables Yale to be New Haven’s largest employer and an economic anchor that generates $8 billion annually for the state’s economy. You can learn more about Yale’s impact.\n\nThe endowment tax is not the only provision in the legislation affecting universities; other provisions would affect student aid, but the steep tax represents the greatest challenge for Yale and our community. If this tax increase is enacted, Yale’s ability to lead and innovate across all fields will be greatly reduced, and the scale of Yale’s impact on humanity will be diminished. The tax also threatens Yale’s longstanding commitment to affordability, which allows Yale to meet all admitted undergraduates’ full financial need without resorting to student loans. Around 85% graduate debt free. Yale is currently tuition free in general to those with family incomes under $150,000 a year.\n\nThe coming few weeks are critical, as this bill will be debated and potentially amended in the Senate. If the Senate approves the bill with modifications from its current version, the Senate and House will need to reconcile any differences before the bill becomes law. We have a window to advocate for the importance of the research, scholarship, and teaching taking place at Yale and peer universities. I urge you to write and call your senators and urge them to reject an increase in the endowment tax, and I urge you to encourage others to do the same.\n\nPlease share the following important information with your representatives in the Senate and House:\n\nThe endowment tax places more financial burden on students by making college less affordable. Taxing schools reduces the revenue available for financial aid.\n\nSchools manage endowments responsibly. Yale spends aggressively from its endowment to support financial aid and research. We spend a quarter of the endowment’s total value every five to six years.\n\nThe endowment tax will undermine the country’s global leadership in technology.\n\nUniversities perform fundamental research that has led to advancements that define modern life, including MRI, GPS, the internet, smartphones, and artificial intelligence, to name just a few.\n\nUniversity research will drive the next generation of innovation, such as quantum computing, that will be critically important to the economy and national security.\n\nIf the endowment tax increase is enacted, America’s great research universities will have less impact and become less able to educate the next generation of innovators, and the U.S. will cede leadership in new technologies to other countries.\n\nI have been working, alongside scores of other university presidents, to share these messages with elected officials to remind them of the central role that Yale and peer universities play in building a highly capable workforce and making the discoveries that strengthen the nation’s economy, competitiveness, and security. I assure you that I will not stop working on this issue until it is settled.\n\nRight now, each of us must make the case for what universities contribute and for what is at stake if we fall behind as a nation in education, research, and scholarship. Join me in sharing what Yale gave all of us and what Yale continues to give our country and the world.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaurie McInnis\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of the History of Art",

    "content": "Members of the Class of 2025:\n\nFamily members, friends, professors, staff, mentors who have helped our graduates along the way...Congratulations!\n\nGraduation is a team sport, as are so many of life’s great achievements. This moment belongs to all of you.\n\nThank you for allowing me to be part of your special day.\n\nWe are fortunate to be joined by so many individuals who are living examples of how you can build on your college experience to lead a life of service and purpose.\n\nI want to thank Major General Charles Bolden for his remarks and his willingness to invest in the next generation of leaders by sharing some of the lessons he’s learned along his own life’s journey.\n\nGeneral Bolden, your words and actions are an example to us all. Thank you.\n\nI also want to express my gratitude to our Distinguished Service Award recipients for all they’ve done for our university, the State of Ohio and our community.\n\nAnd I extend my congratulations to our honorary degree recipient, Dr. Gawande.\n\nIt would be easy to look at the resumes of the individuals we’ve honored today and think, “I’m not sure I could do that.”\n\nWhether they’ve flown into space, authored a bestselling book, pioneered new medical treatments, built successful businesses or become pillars in their communities, this is certainly an accomplished group of people.\n\nBut look closer.\n\nThe people on this stage have something in common. Something that is an example to all of us. Something the world needs more of.\n\nThey have all answered a call to serve the greater good.\n\nThis is a lesson to us all. Each and every one of us can live a life of service.\n\nThat may take the form of public service, or philanthropy, or community leadership or military service. It may mean raising a family or doing the everyday things that make our community a better place.\n\nThe point is, we all have an opportunity and a calling to be a force for good.\n\nWith the Ohio State degree you are earning today, I know you will answer that call, and make the world a better place.\n\nAnd when you set out to create good, there’s a multiplier effect. Each act of service, each positive interaction with another person, has an impact far beyond what you might think possible.\n\nThe journey will not always be easy.\n\nI can tell you this from my own life experience. Things will not always go as you planned. There will be difficult and unexpected challenges.\n\nYou’ve already seen this up close and personal. Many of you were in high school at a time when our world was facing an unprecedented crisis.\n\nYou may have had to miss or modify some of the rites of passage traditionally associated with this period of your life.\n\nMore than once, you had to change direction on a moment’s notice.\n\nAnd I know that beyond the challenges that made it into the headlines, most of you have been dealt your own private challenges.\n\nYou have responded as Buckeyes do.\n\nYou’ve worked hard, you’ve stayed the course, you’ve treated others with the grace and compassion they deserve, and you’ve made it here, to this day, your graduation.\n\nAnd what an achievement this is.\n\nThe choice you have made to invest in yourself with a college education is one of the wisest decisions you will ever make.\n\nThis degree is something no one can ever take away. The relationships you have formed and memories you have made as a Buckeye will last a lifetime.\n\nThe things you’ve learned – the ideas and concepts you’ve discussed and debated in the classroom as well as the skills you’ve gained outside our buildings – will serve you for the rest of your lives.\n\nYou leave here knowing HOW to think, not what to think. You know how to engage with people and ideas different from your own. You have built a curiosity about the world and a passion for lifelong learning.\n\nYou may not fully realize it sitting here today, but you have changed the trajectory of your life forever.\n\nI have seen it time and time again. There is no more transformative force in a person’s life than education.\n\nApproximately 12,000 degrees are being earned today, and each carries a unique story.\n\nBy the way, each diploma that will be awarded today also bears the unique name of the graduate who earned it. That’s a special touch that sets Ohio State apart.\n\nI wish I could tell all 12,000 of those stories. But I know you are eager to celebrate the day. So I will share just a few.\n\nLet me say this. The Buckeye Class of 2025 is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWe have Jordan Loeffler, a chemical and biomolecular engineering graduate who used her senior thesis project to develop a therapeutic agent for a genetic disease that will change lives.\n\nWe have Katelyn Abeln, an Olympian who competed in Paris in the air pistol event.\n\nWe have Christopher Ayoub, an M.D./Ph.D. graduate pursuing new treatments for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. A powerful reminder that research done at America’s universities not only changes lives, but literally saves lives.\n\nWe have stories of remarkable grit, resilience and perseverance.\n\nLike Theodore Schwartz, an 88-year-old who attended Ohio State in the 1950s and is now earning his diploma.\n\nAnd Lorenzo Styles, a Buckeye football great who began his degree, went on to a successful career in the NFL, and has now come back to finish what he started.\n\nAnd so many more.\n\nStories like these are exactly what our land-grant public university is all about.\n\nThey are exactly what we’re talking about when we cite Ohio State’s motto of “Education for Citizenship.”\n\nThe students we’re celebrating today are exactly the reason our university exists… The reason we come to work every day.\n\nAnd I know each and every one of you has an equally meaningful story – filled with hopes and dreams, ups and downs, and your own special memories of what it means to be a Buckeye.\n\nYou may be graduating today, but remember that you are a part of the Buckeye family forever.\n\nOn behalf of the entire leadership team of Ohio State University, I am so proud of you, and so excited for all that you will accomplish in the years ahead.\n\nWe will be cheering you on every step of the way.\n\nNow, go change the world.",

    "content": "As grades were being calculated and the Yard was being transformed into a stage for Commencement, President Alan Garber sat down with the Gazette to reflect on the challenges of a turbulent year and the promise of graduation day.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nStudents are preparing to graduate in what is always one of the most celebratory and hopeful weeks of the year. You received an economics degree from Harvard College in 1976. Do you remember your state of mind that day — whether you felt a sense of purpose?\n\nAt the time, I probably would have told you that I did. I had already decided to pursue both a Ph.D. in economics and an M.D. I was certainly excited about learning economics at a deeper level and becoming a physician. But I had only a vague idea of what would come after I completed my formal studies.\n\nWhat I did have was a sense that I would be well-equipped to grapple with important health policy issues, with a program of study that was unusual at the time. Above all else, I felt grateful to my fellow students from whom I learned so much, toward the faculty who worked with me, advised me, and inspired me, and toward the institution as a whole for giving me a chance to become part of a great community.\n\nCombining economics and medicine would likely never have occurred to me had I gone to college elsewhere. My path was probably set when I took Ec10, which was nearly a universal course at the time — about three-quarters of Harvard undergrads took it. If not for that, I might have become a doctor of a different kind.\n\nHarvard and higher education have been caught up in a deeply politicized environment, and we’ve seen the federal government cut research funding and launch investigations into institutions. What do you say to members of the community concerned about the University’s future?\n\nWe should all be concerned that colleges and universities have increasingly come under attack. But we should not dismiss the criticisms even when they are based on distortions or inaccuracies — we need to look for the underlying concerns that can be embedded in them. For example, many members of our community have been alarmed that students have become increasingly reluctant to speak openly about controversial or uncomfortable topics, especially if they believe their personal views are unpopular. That’s a problem we need to solve, and over the past year and a half we’ve done a great deal to address it. Many of those efforts are described in the report of the working group on open inquiry and constructive dialogue.\n\nStill, we believe that the government overreach and devastating attacks on scientific and medical research are unwarranted and unlawful, and so we have taken legal action to defend the institution.\n\nThere are also concerns about the cost of higher education and the value it offers students. In fact, the actual cost of attending Harvard College is much lower than people may think. We offer generous financial aid, so, for most Americans, it would cost less to attend Harvard than a state university. The actual cost of attendance for the average student receiving financial aid — more than half of all undergraduates — is roughly $13,000. And starting with this year’s entering class, Harvard will be tuition-free for children from families earning less than $200,000 per year.\n\nWe need to ensure that the public has a better understanding not only of the affordability of the education we offer, but also of the benefits we provide to our students and the public at large. We’re a research university, always striving to expand the boundaries of knowledge. That has large and very tangible benefits for our country, often manifested in contributions to economic growth and to better health. When we look ahead, I am confident that the value of research universities will continue to be widely recognized and that we will be successful for the long term, despite the challenges we’re facing today.\n\nLast week, the University secured a temporary restraining order blocking the federal government from removing F and J visas from Harvard students starting next academic year. Can you talk about the University’s quick response and what’s next?\n\nWe needed to move quickly because the consequences of revocation of visas for our international students were dire. These are students who are following their dreams at Harvard. Their contributions to our community are deep and extensive; they bring with them their expertise and insight as well as unique perspectives and experiences, which they share in the classroom, in residences, and everywhere that students can be found. We are doing all we can to ensure that these and future students can successfully pursue their studies at Harvard.\n\nThere will be a hearing in court later this week where we will argue that the restraining order should be extended. And even though we were successful last week, we recognize that there will continue to be many questions and concerns. The Harvard International Office is working closely with our international students to help.\n\nHow might the unsettled environment for students affect learning? Are there important lessons even in times of conflict?\n\nLearning often advances most rapidly during times of conflict. We gain a new understanding of our strengths and weaknesses. We often learn that we can do what we didn’t think was possible.\n\nAs we think about impediments to open dialogue and how we’ve addressed them, I believe that students who are graduating now have gained a deeper understanding of what it means to truly listen to, and speak with, another person. I hope that our students — indeed every member of our community — will have learned that forming close relationships, especially with people who are different from us, is intensely rewarding. Along the way, we will develop greater empathy and learn valuable lessons.\n\nWhat challenges and opportunities do you see for graduates? It seems safe to say that artificial intelligence counts as both, in significant ways.\n\nIt’s too soon to predict how AI will change the lives and careers of graduating students, but knowing how to work with AI is already advantageous in some areas of work and essentially a requirement in others. With the rapid progress in generative AI, we’re seeing that specific skills in its use — say, prompt engineering — can become less important as the technology evolves.\n\nI expect that, overall, the people who will thrive in the economy of the future are those who are adept at using technological tools well. But who will those people be? We have people working on scientific problems whose expertise is in AI, and others whose expertise is in a specific area of science, and many whose expertise is a blend of each. What will be the best mix? We’ll be learning this in many domains of application in the coming years.\n\nI count myself among those who think that basic human skills — empathy, compassion, and interest in other people — will be more important than ever as the reach of AI expands.\n\nHow do you balance the demands of hard, time-consuming problems versus those that require a quick decision?\n\nYou don’t usually have a choice — you need to deal with both. But even when there are quick decisions to be made, we should always think about long-term consequences. As we approach our 400th anniversary as an institution, we continue to benefit from far-sighted decisions of our predecessors. A long-term perspective enables us to make investments today whose payoffs will be long-delayed but consequential — even transformative. That is the fundamental premise of basic science research, for example, but it applies far more broadly.\n\nYou recently announced that the University will dedicate $250 million to support research at the Schools. What can that money do and what can it not do?\n\nThe support that we’re providing is intended to facilitate the continuity of our research efforts. It is meant to ensure that we can maintain a strong base of research and minimize the disruption of the research enterprise that comes from the federal denial of research funding. It cannot sustain our research operations for the long term, so we are taking a close look at ways to further lower the costs of conducting research and to diversify the sources of funding. However, the research advances at Harvard and other universities that have led to the scientific pre-eminence of the United States would not have been possible without federal research support. The partnership between universities and the federal government is important for this country’s future scientific accomplishments, not only at Harvard but also at other universities throughout the nation.\n\nWhen we talk about lowering the cost of research, is that seen as a way to get through a difficult time or might there be changes that spark innovation and lower costs over the long term?\n\nThe latter. Our efforts to improve the efficiency of the scientific enterprise may be more intense at a time of financial stress, but we should always look for ways to do more with less money. This won’t be easy. Some of the most important scientific advances are inherently expensive. For example, we’ve made investments in cryo-electron microscopy, a recently developed technology that requires large capital investments but has led to extraordinary scientific advances. Expensive tools, used appropriately, can find answers more quickly and less expensively than the approaches they replace. To keep costs down often means that we need to invest wisely, which sometimes means making a smaller number of large but strategic investments. Our researchers are creative and ingenious. I am confident that they will find new ways to do truly cutting-edge research more efficiently.\n\nIs the endowment being considered as an additional funding source?\n\nThe endowment already supports the operating budgets of our Schools, much of it directed toward research activities. About 80 percent of the endowment is subject to restrictions: We can’t use money intended to support a professor of economics, for example, to fund scientists in a molecular biology lab. So, although it’s a critical asset, the endowment — and ours consists of roughly 14,000 endowment funds — can’t be used as a general-purpose fund or, as some people say, as a rainy-day account. In addition, an endowment is intended to be available in perpetuity. Recognizing those constraints, the endowment certainly can be helpful.\n\nIf there were to be declines in the value of the endowment — if, for example, the large endowment tax in the House budget bill were passed into law — it would affect all of these activities. The impact would be particularly severe for financial aid, which is heavily supported by endowment funds.\n\nWith regard to antisemitism and other forms of bias, how sure are you that the steps Harvard is taking will alter the campus environment?\n\nWe’re building on work that we have undertaken over the course of the last year and a half, along with the recently released final recommendations of the two task forces. The Schools and the University are working on implementation of those recommendations. It’s worth reviewing the recommendations to appreciate their scope — they apply to many different aspects of University life.\n\nSome of the interventions we’ve undertaken or planned are quite specifically targeted to improve the lives of Jewish students. Others are intended to educate the University community. The latter areas include orientation programs, training of faculty, and the addition of new courses that relate to the topics of antisemitism and the history of the Middle East. But much of what we are doing involves changing attitudes toward one another, facilitating constructive speech and constructive disagreement, and building bridges across different identities and student groups. It’s a multifaceted strategy intended to change culture on campus.\n\nIf that strategy is fully successful, we will have made vital progress in tackling hate and bias, and it will prevent the shunning and other forms of social exclusion reported by Jewish and Israeli students; by Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students; and by other members of our community. There can be no place for hate at Harvard.\n\nAs to the effectiveness of the actions we’re undertaking, it may be too early to tell. But reports of a more open and less tense campus atmosphere throughout the academic year that is now ending give me hope that even our early efforts are bearing fruit.\n\nAlthough we know that Harvard alone will not end antisemitism — it has been a stain on humanity for more than 2,000 years and is pervasive in the world — we need to do all we can to address it with resolve and with humility, knowing that it will require sustained effort.\n\nSimilarly, we need to pursue educational approaches, make accommodations for the practice of religion, and build empathy. We have heard a similar set of stories about how Muslim or Palestinian students often feel unwelcome and isolated. Our programs regarding speech and building bridges across differences are designed to help with all forms of hate and discrimination.\n\nThat would align with steps the University is taking to encourage viewpoint diversity and constructive disagreement?\n\nYes, these are mutually reinforcing efforts. We want to ensure that our students are exposed to diverse perspectives on the issues that we study, discuss, and research. We often hear complaints that universities like ours have a political monoculture, because politically our faculty and students skew to the left when compared to Americans overall. This means that there is at least a risk — particularly in the social sciences and humanities — that our community will not be exposed to the full range of ideas that should be discussed and debated. Furthermore, people who hold minority views on campus may feel uncomfortable expressing them. Surveys generally confirm these impressions.\n\nPart of the challenge is to ensure that people who bring more diverse views will feel welcome on our campus and free to express their views. We are developing plans to bring respected, rigorous, and compelling voices to campus, including tenured faculty, who will expand our intellectual horizons and bring new insights into many fields, such as those related to policy, government, and law.\n\nAn immediate challenge is to nurture an environment of openness and mutual respect that will encourage people who fear that their views are unpopular to feel comfortable expressing them. So, what must we do as an institution to ensure those views can be heard?\n\nThis is where our efforts to promote open discourse and constructive dialogue should make a difference. It’s important for faculty to model this behavior in the classroom and create an atmosphere where students feel comfortable expressing views that others may not agree with. We’ve begun that work and will continue to build on it.\n\nIt is obviously not a secular university’s role to dictate a set of values, but do you think Harvard students leave campus with a stronger foundation for developing their own?\n\nEncouraging thinking about values is pervasive in the University. It’s in the obvious places, like philosophy and the Divinity School, but it’s also a prominent topic in the Business School. It’s in the humanities in general. Almost all great literature presents situations that provoke thinking about what constitutes ethical behavior, why people knowingly commit wrongs, and the consequences of failing to act according to one’s values.\n\nI doubt that any Harvard College student can graduate without having to grapple with questions about values. Judging from the enrollments in Michael Sandel’s “Justice” course, they don’t want to miss the opportunity. As in so much else, we want to help our students learn how to think about values and how to act on them, but that doesn’t mean that we should tell them which values they should adopt. Except “veritas.” I hope that every graduate embraces the importance of truth and chooses to live by it.",

    "content": "The 580 members of Middlebury College’s Class of 2025—universally described as resilient because of their perseverance through a global pandemic and other world events—celebrated Commencement in the presence of family and friends on May 25.\n\nIn a ceremony that included long-held traditions, speeches, music, and the conferral of honorary degrees, the graduates were celebrated for their accomplishments including national fellowships and scholarships, academic honors, athletic and artistic achievements and community engagement. Bagpiper Timothy Cummings opened the ceremony by leading the class from Old Chapel to the Commencement grounds, where the Constitution Brass Quintet played the processional. In keeping with tradition, the students paused before entering the seating area, formed a gauntlet and applauded as the faculty walked through.\n\nBrandon Straker delivered the student speech. (Credit: Brett Simison )\n\nStudent Government Association President Brandon Straker, a political science major from Washington, D.C., delivered the student address. He noted that he was the first in his family to attend college and had an unlikely journey to Middlebury. After graduating from high school at the height of the pandemic, he found himself teaching seventh-grade math in Texas, never imagining college was a possibility. Then he met Jason Mims, founder of the Mims Institute, which supports underrepresented students preparing for top colleges. Mims became an important mentor for Straker, inspiring him to apply to Middlebury, a move that changed the course of his life. Mims traveled from Texas to attend Sunday’s ceremony. “Each one of us has a story to tell—a story about how someone in our life, whether a parent, or mentor, teacher, or coach pushed us on our way to persevere,” said Straker. “I have come to learn that the best of our accomplishments is not ever done in isolation. We do not have these accomplishments alone.” Straker said he will return to his old school in Washington, D.C., next week as a volunteer for Teach for America, hoping to inspire a new generation of future Middlebury students.\n\nChuck Davis gave the Commencement address to the Class of 2025. (Credit: Brett Simison )\n\nInvestment executive and philanthropist Chuck Davis gave the Commencement address and, along with his wife, Marna, received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree. The founder and chairman of Stone Point Capital, Davis offered the class six points of advice drawn from his life experience and 50-year career. He included these tips and more in a website he’s building—a “MiddKit”—that he hopes will serve as a helpful resource for the class. “It is wonderful what you have accomplished,” Davis told the graduates. “I never made it to the seat you are sitting in now. Would you mind if I see what it feels like?” With that, Davis hopped off the stage, took an empty seat, and sat with the graduates for a few seconds before returning to the podium. He explained that he had attended Middlebury, where he struggled academically, for only two years before transferring to the University of Vermont. He later used those struggles as motivation when he launched his career on Wall Street. Davis reminded graduates facing a challenging world not to fear failure, but rather to expect and embrace it. The native Vermonter said failure was something he “knew quite a bit about,” and that failure can often be more important to personal development than success. “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone,” said Davis. Chuck and Marna Davis are cofounders and co-chairs of the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation, an organization focused on a rare liver cancer that primarily occurs in adolescents and young adults. The foundation carries on the legacy of their son, Tucker, one of the foundation’s cofounders, who died of fibrolamellar cancer at age 28. The Davises are also cofounders of the Chuck and Marna Davis Foundation—a Vermont-focused foundation that supports numerous educational and other worthy causes.\n\nMembers of the Class of 2025 with their canes.

    "content": "To: Wellesley College Community\n\nFrom: President Paula A. Johnson\n\nRe: How Wellesley is responding to national challenges to higher education\n\nDate: May 13, 2025\n\n\n\nI know the past several months have been a time of uncertainty and challenge for many in our community. The unprecedented attacks on institutions of higher education in particular have cut to the heart of our most cherished values—the principle of academic freedom, the critical importance of the research enterprise, and the inherent belief in higher education as a public good—and they have endangered the safety and dignity of our international students, who contribute significantly to our campus.\n\nOne of the most serious threats is proposed legislation introduced yesterday in the U.S. House of Representatives that, if implemented, could increase the tax on realized gains from Wellesley’s endowment from 1.4% to 14%. This would be devastating for the College. We depend on our endowment for the generous financial aid we provide to more than half of our student body, and for operating support.\n\nWe are working with more than two dozen small colleges from across the country to educate members of Congress about the significant impact this increased tax would have on our ability to offer financial aid and to carry out our educational mission. In the weeks ahead, we will keep our community updated as the budget reconciliation process moves forward.\n\nIn the face of these and other challenges, we are standing by our values and taking action to support our students, current and future.\n\nFirst, we are strengthening our commitment to making Wellesley affordable for students and families with the addition of about $3 million in financial aid, approved by the board of trustees earlier this year. By updating the methodology we use to award aid and increase the amount we provide, we will be better able to meet the needs of our students and families.\n\nSecond, we are supporting our international students, who are facing unprecedented uncertainty regarding their visa status. We made it a priority to protect them during the recent strike by enabling them to maintain their full-time status in compliance with their visa requirements. We have hosted information sessions for them with immigration experts and have worked to find internships and job placements for those who want to stay in the U.S. this summer.\n\nWellesley is a member of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, which has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal government’s termination of international students’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records with the goal of ensuring that any changes to the SEVIS process are done in compliance with all applicable regulatory procedures.\n\nThird, we are focused on our campus culture. Across our community, we are addressing antisemitism and other forms of discrimination by requiring training that educates all members of our community about Title VI protections.\n\nWe have also doubled down on our work to improve how we teach our students to engage across difference. And through our faculty-led Pluralism Initiative and other efforts, we are welcoming differing points of view as core to robust learning in search of the truth.\n\nAt a time when higher education is being challenged as never before, I take strength from our community’s shared commitment to providing access, opportunity, and an excellent education to our students and to upholding the principles of academic freedom. Those commitments have guided us for 150 years, and they will continue to do so in the future.",

It is important to remember that a mediator is a neutral party who does not make decisions, issue any reports or rulings, or take public positions on anything in dispute. The entire process is confidential, and both parties are ultimately responsible for approving all aspects of a final contract.\n\nThe parties will begin the mediation process on May 15 with a preliminary meeting with Ms. Shea.",

However, we find it necessary to respond to a rumor that is circulating that the College threatened to report noncitizen union employees to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\n\n\nThis is false. The College has not threatened union members, and it has not “weaponized” the visa status of any noncitizen employees. But the occurrence of a strike did create risk for some noncitizen employees.\n\n\n\nBy law, the College must report a strike by our employees to the U.S. Department of Labor within three days of the occurrence of the strike. The law allows the labor department to provide notice of a strike to DHS, and any petition to extend or change an employee’s H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 visa status may be denied while a strike is ongoing. This risk applies to all employees in the occupational category of the striking workers, which includes both tenure track and non-tenure track faculty. The stated purpose of the law is to protect striking workers by ensuring that an employer is not hiring noncitizen workers to do the jobs of striking employees.\n\n\n\nEarly in the strike, the College carefully reviewed the visa status of each impacted noncitizen faculty member and communicated with them directly about whether the strike could affect their current visa status and/or renewal. We invited affected employees to follow up with the College’s immigration attorney with any questions about their individual situations.\n\n\n\nNow that the strike has ended, the College is working with the impacted faculty members to move their visa petitions forward on an expedited basis.\n\n\n\nWe encourage any community member who has questions or concerns about this issue or other serious matters to bring them to us directly, so that we may provide the information you need to make informed judgments.",

    "content": "To: Wellesley College Community\n\nFrom: Courtney Coile, Provost and Lia Gelin Poorvu ’56 Dean of the College, and Carolyn Slaboden, Chief Human Resources Officer\n\nRe: College’s comprehensive three-year contract offer significantly increases NTT faculty salaries\n\nDate: April 23, 2025\n\nIn a significant move aimed at ending the nearly monthlong strike, yesterday the College offered WOAW-UAW, the union that represents our non-tenure track (NTT) faculty, a comprehensive three-year contract that would increase salaries for unionized NTT faculty by more than 26% over three years. Under the terms of the offer, total salaries for unionized NTT faculty would increase by 16% in the first year, bringing the average salary to more than $100,000 in year one of the contract. The union has agreed to the College’s request for a bargaining session today to discuss this proposal.\n\nThe offer reflects major movement on the part of the College in terms of both compensation and contract duration, acceding to the union’s request for a three-year agreement. The College previously had proposed a four-year contract.\n\nSignificant disagreement remains between the parties on the issue of teaching load. The College has proposed a teaching load of five courses per year for full-time NTT faculty in the union. The union, however, wants to continue the status quo for lecturers and senior lecturers, including instructors in science laboratory (ISLs)—a teaching load of four courses per year—while agreeing to maintain the current five-course load for visiting lecturers.\n\nIn the spirit of compromise, the College has offered current union members who carry a four-course teaching load the option to continue to do so. Lecturers and senior lecturers who teach five courses would receive significantly higher compensation: $12,000 added to their base salary in year one of the contract. All newly hired, full-time lecturers would teach five courses a year.\n\nSome may wonder why the College is asking for a five-course annual load for all unionized NTT faculty in the first place. Simply put: It will help ensure the long-term excellence of our academic program. Classroom teaching is how NTT faculty provide the most benefit to our students. In addition, having NTT faculty teach five courses rather than four increases the number of high-demand and required courses we can offer with a faculty of our size.\n\nRequiring a five-course load would also allow our longer-term lecturers and senior lecturers to teach more of our students, who would benefit from their experience and from building meaningful connections with them. Over time, the College would hire fewer new visiting lecturers, who serve on shorter-term contracts.\n\nThe five-course teaching load reflects the different roles and responsibilities of NTT and tenure track faculty. While our tenure track faculty have a four-course load, as a condition of their employment they are expected to engage in scholarship and research and to take on major service roles, such as chairing their departments and participating in and chairing numerous College-wide governance bodies. NTT faculty have no scholarship or research responsibilities, and during the ongoing negotiations the parties have agreed to limit their service expectations in ways that will create additional time to teach a fifth class. NTT and tenure track faculty have similar advising responsibilities.\n\nA five- or six-course teaching load is the standard for NTT faculty across nearly all of our peer institutions, including Wesleyan, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Barnard, MIT, Tufts, and Boston College.\n\nDespite union arguments to the contrary, a five-course workload will not compromise the quality of teaching. Dozens of bargaining unit members have taught a fifth course in recent years when the need has arisen, as our visiting lecturers do as part of their regular teaching load, and student evaluation (SEQ) data clearly demonstrate that the share of Wellesley students who recommend their instructors is extremely high whether the instructor is teaching two or three courses in that semester. And Wellesley’s tenure track faculty provide students with an excellent education, including offering plenty of office hours and one-on-one mentoring, while carrying out significant research and scholarship and meeting other obligations in addition to teaching four courses per year.\n\nThe union has argued that it would take time to figure out how to adjust to a new workload. Our proposal takes that into account: The NTT faculty’s workload in 2025–26 will be the same as this year. While lecturers and senior lecturers who teach five courses will receive an additional $12,000 to salary in year one of the contract, they will not be required to teach the fifth course until the 2026–27 academic year.\n\nWe urge the union to engage its full membership in serious discussions about the College’s comprehensive proposal. It is time for us to come together and finalize a fair and competitive contract that benefits our non-tenure track faculty, our students, and the entire College community.\n\nPlease visit our dedicated union-related website for more information.",

    "content": "To: Wellesley College Community\n\nFrom: Courtney Coile, Provost and Lia Gelin Poorvu ’56 Dean of the College, and Carolyn Slaboden, Chief Human Resources Officer\n\nRe: Update on negotiations with WOAW-UAW\n\nDate: April 16, 2025\n\nTomorrow the College and WOAW-UAW, the union representing Wellesley’s non-tenure track (NTT) faculty, will resume the collective bargaining process. The College will approach this session as we have all sessions to date—in a spirit of good-faith negotiation with the goal of finalizing a fair contract.\n\nWe appreciate that the union is coming to the table with a new proposal, as we had asked. Because we have not reviewed it completely nor discussed it with them yet, we cannot comment on the specifics at this time.\n\nWe do want to be clear, however, that we reject the idea put forward by the union that a one-year contract would in any way benefit the College community. We are unwilling to put our students, faculty, and community at risk of experiencing the same disruption a year from now. The College is asking for a multiyear contract to ensure that no current students will experience another strike during their time at Wellesley. A multiyear contract would also help NTT faculty by locking in raises for the next several years—a period of expected financial uncertainty—and securing access to new benefits. Our community needs a multiyear contract so that we can move past this time of division and begin to heal.\n\nThe union does not need a one-year contract in order to end the strike and return to the classroom. They can do that today. And despite the union’s suggestions that our students are “losing” any part of their education, thanks to the academic plan the College put in place after NTT faculty decided to strike, all students will be able to finish the semester in good academic standing.\n\nWe look forward to a productive bargaining session tomorrow.",

This means our revenues are growing at a slower rate than our expenses. As part of our efforts to address this, we will be implementing a six-month hiring pause for faculty and staff, effective immediately. This pause will apply to tenure track, non-tenure track, administrative (both exempt and non-exempt), and union staff positions. The pause does not apply to student workers.\n\nAs we implement this pause, we recognize that there will be a limited number of vacant positions that will be critical to the academic and residential program and to essential College operations. The Provost Budget Committee (PBC), which regularly reviews staffing requests, will be responsible for reviewing all hiring requests for faculty or staff during this time and will make recommendations to Senior Leadership for approval.\n\nWe are also exploring other actions to address the FY26 deficit and longer-term spending, including reviewing discretionary and non-salary spending across academic and administrative departments.\n\nThese changes will help slow spending as we address the near-term FY26 financials. The College faces additional, more significant financial uncertainties in the coming year, including a potential increase in the endowment tax as well as possible reductions in federal research funding. Going forward, we will continue to assess these financial risks, and we will keep the College community informed as we address changing financial realities and consider additional steps to mitigate their impact.\n\nWe plan to revisit this hiring pause in the late fall when we have a clearer picture of the external economic risks and challenges we face.\n\nThank you for your understanding and dedication as we strive to provide an excellent liberal arts education for our students.",

Negotiation is a process during which both sides must act in good faith. It requires compromise, and it requires considering each other’s proposals. The UAW is doing neither.\n\n\n\nThe UAW has every right to continue to strike in support of its positions. What remains remarkable is why, when the deadlock on major issues is apparent and the strike has gone on for two full weeks, the UAW continues to reject mediation.\n\n\n\nThe College’s position is clear: We stand ready to continue negotiating if and when the union shows willingness to take major steps forward. We believe holding bargaining sessions during which the College offers proposals that the UAW refuses to consider is fruitless and will not advance our shared goal of finalizing a contract. We once again call on the UAW to agree to mediation, a logical next step when two sides have exhausted their efforts to reach an agreement.\n\n\n\nAs always, additional information can be found at the College’s dedicated website.",

    "content": "To: Wellesley College Community\n\nFrom: Courtney Coile, Provost and Lia Gelin Poorvu ’56 Dean of the College, and Carolyn Slaboden, Chief Human Resources Officer\n\nRe: In a bid to end strike, College puts major compromises on table; union refuses to engage\n\nDate: April 3, 2025\n\n\n\nAs the WOAW-UAW strike enters its second week, today the College offered a major compromise on workload. The union rejected the offer and refused to discuss the College’s other proposals.\n\n\n\nOver two bargaining sessions this week, the College brought a total of 23 proposals to the table that, taken together, address all but two of the remaining articles of the contract being negotiated. The College made this push in a determined effort to allow the two parties to move toward agreement more quickly and bring the strike to a close.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, today the union offered only an overview of the proposals it had shared earlier in the week and an unrealistic revision to its compensation proposal.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding that workload has been one of the major sticking points in our negotiations, the College offered a significant compromise that would allow current lecturers and instructors of science laboratory (ISLs) to opt out of the proposed five-course load for the duration of their time at Wellesley. Rather than embrace this good-faith proposal, which would have resolved many issues, the union flatly rejected the offer without suggesting compromises of their own.\n\n\n\nAdditional examples of the progress the College offered this week include:\n\nA new Dependent Care provision under which families with children age 5 or younger would receive a pretax benefit of $5,000.\n\nA set of new Leave proposals , including a semester of fully paid parental leave, after only one year of faculty service for lecturers and ISLs.\n\nOn Discrimination and Harassment , the College accepted the union’s request to add the category of citizenship in the contract’s antidiscrimination commitment.\n\nOn Promotions , the College made it easier for faculty to be promoted to senior lecturer and the newly introduced rank of principal lecturer by shortening the service requirement to eight years.\n\nThe College agreed to limit rents for faculty housing to 70% of market rents for the life of the contract.\n\nThe union declined to discuss any of the articles the College put on the table this week, then said they would engage on individual issues only if the College presented all the articles in one comprehensive package—a highly unusual request that goes against general negotiating practice when so many issues remain open. The College considers this all-or-nothing approach unproductive, especially in the middle of an ongoing strike that is having such a negative impact on our community.\n\n\n\nThe College offered to add a negotiation session on Monday, which the union accepted. However, given the union’s refusal to engage in a substantive discussion of the proposals the College presented today, we see a diminishing path toward progress. The College emphatically calls on the union to agree to use a neutral, third-party mediator whose sole purpose would be to jointly bring the parties to a final contract.",

    "content": "April 6, 2025 Members of the Rutgers Community: We take pride in Rutgers’ standing as one of the most richly diverse state universities in the nation. Contributing in so many ways to the strength of our diversity are the thousands of students, faculty, scholars, clinicians, and staff who come here from other countries. Rutgers is truly an international university: our classrooms and labs form microcosms of the global community, bringing people from different cultures and nationalities together to study and solve the world’s most pressing challenges. We deeply benefit from—and we strongly support—our international students and scholars. Recent media reports regarding travel bans and visa reviews by the federal government have created uncertainty and fear. Here at Rutgers, as at other universities across the country, students who are in good academic standing have learned that their lawful status in the United States has been terminated without explanation. The university has been in touch with these students to provide information and guidance. While the number of such instances at Rutgers is limited thus far, the effect is understandably chilling to our international community. To all our international students and scholars, I pledge our continued commitment to support you. Through Rutgers Global, and international student services offices on each campus, we provide assistance and resources to the international community and help with visa processing, academic support, and advocacy and outreach. Rutgers Global also sends global alerts related to travel advisories, immigration policies, and other regulatory updates. Another critical resource for our international students is the Rutgers Immigrant Community Assistance Project (RICAP), located within Rutgers Law School and led by managing attorney Jason Hernandez. RICAP offers free and confidential legal consultations to all students experiencing immigration concerns. Rutgers students in need of its services can e-mail RICAP-Info@law.rutgers.edu. Please take advantage of these services if you or someone you know at Rutgers has any concerns about immigration status or needs to talk to someone about their situation. We will continue to monitor and keep you apprised of federal actions regarding immigration and all other issues that affect the Rutgers community. Sincerely,\n\n\n\nJonathan Holloway\n\nPresident and University Professor",

    "content": "March 27, 2025\n\nDear Faculty and Staff Colleagues:\n\nAs we enter one of the busiest months of our academic year, I want to keep you apprised of federal and state policies and plans, as many of the policies either adopted or proposed have the potential to impact Rutgers directly. I am sharing this information with my assurance that we are taking these matters seriously—but also with my confidence that Rutgers is in a strong position and will continue to carry out our mission through your excellent efforts across the university and beyond.\n\nFederal Actions\n\nLast week, the U.S. executive branch announced plans to close the federal Department of Education. While eliminating the department requires congressional action, media reports indicate numerous functions are being taken offline or moved—most notably student grants and student loans, which are reported to be shifting to another agency. We will do all we can to provide guidance as this situation develops, given the disruption such major changes may cause. The university’s primary concern is the continued support of our students, many of whom depend on functions within the Department of Education. That’s why we are supporting a multi-state legal challenge to the executive branch’s action based on the financial and operational harm it could do to the university and our students.\n\nSimilarly, we are watching closely to ensure that our international students are supported during this moment of shifting immigration policies, immigration enforcement activity around university campuses, and the possibility of restrictions on international travel and other enforcement measures being implemented. Our university community is international, and in times of challenge and uncertainty, Rutgers remains dedicated to fostering a secure and supportive academic environment for ALL our students, scholars, faculty, and staff. Rutgers Global continues to provide up-to-date guidance to students and other members of our international community who need it.\n\nI also want to remind you of the university’s guidance related to what to do if you see immigration and other law enforcement activity around campus, which is to call RUPD. Additional details of this guidance are posted to our FAQ page, Navigating New Federal Government Actions and Requirements.\n\nI shared earlier this month how the attorneys general of New Jersey and other states had broadly affirmed Rutgers’ approach to diversity. Rutgers is committed to inclusion, not exclusion, and to creating opportunities for all. Our diversity strategic plan articulates this goal, and it is the university’s expectation that its programs supporting our students, faculty, and staff are open to all and compliant with state and federal law.\n\nThe Continuing Resolution passed by Congress this month to fund the federal government through September 30 maintains the current Facilities and Administration (F&A) rate for the institution, alleviating for now a significant source of concern for research and university operations. The NIH’s proposed cap of 15% for F&A would have had a more than $50 million impact on the university and done irreparable harm to our research programs and the broader community. The university will continue to advocate for federal support for university-based research, recognizing its vital contributions to innovation and America’s well-being.\n\nState Budget\n\nAs we watch the federal budget closely, we are also monitoring the development of the New Jersey budget, which is being formulated as the state attempts to reduce its structural deficit. The governor’s budget, presented last month, includes nearly $2 billion in discretionary funding cuts statewide, with $70 million identified for Rutgers through proposed reductions in operating support to public higher education, the Garden State Guarantee, and the Summer Tuition Assistance Grant program, as well as numerous line-item cuts to individual university programs. [Note: Under the Governor’s proposed cut to the Garden State Guarantee (GSG), all current students already benefiting from it would continue to receive the GSG as long as they continue to meet the income and eligibility requirements. Incoming students with family incomes under $65,000 would also be eligible. The cuts would, however, eliminate GSG support for new students with family incomes above $65,000, who would no longer qualify.]\n\nRutgers is proud of its role supporting the state’s economy by educating its workforce, being among its largest employers, and serving the people of New Jersey. Our Government Relations team is working closely with our partners and colleagues in Trenton to improve the budget outlook and advocate for restorations to vital programs. In the meantime, deans and university leadership have been advised to carefully consider hiring plans, travel, and large expenses until the budget outlook is clarified. As university-wide offices planned for next year’s budget, they were instructed to reduce their budgets in anticipation of financial pressures.\n\nAs I close, I want to reiterate the importance of carrying out our mission through the work we do together every day: educating and supporting our students, conducting research that improves the well-being of humanity, and serving our communities and our patients. Let’s remember the great good that Rutgers does and keep our focus on this extraordinary mission during these final weeks of the academic year. And whatever your role on campus, whether faculty or staff, please know that your service to our mission is valued and appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJonathan Holloway\n\nPresident and University Professor",

    "content": "March 7, 2025\n\nDear Faculty and Staff:\n\n\n\nI write in the spirit of keeping our community informed during what has been a period of uncertainty for higher education at the federal level.\n\n\n\nMany in our community have raised questions about the “Dear Colleague” letter issued by the U.S. Department of Education last month. Earlier this week, the attorneys general of multiple states, including New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, issued guidance on this letter to colleges and universities. This guidance broadly affirms our university’s approach to diversity: one focused on inclusion, not exclusion, on fostering opportunity for all, and on compliance with state and federal law.\n\n\n\nAs I shared in February with the entire community, Rutgers considers diversity to be necessary to foster the cultural competencies, resilience, and openness to dialogue that promote the intellectual growth and understanding that are essential for success in the classroom, the university community, and society at large.\n\n\n\nIn addition, a federal judge this week issued a preliminary injunction against the NIH’s plan to reduce the F&A (indirect costs) reimbursement rate for universities to 15% for all its research grants, a change that would significantly reduce funding for critical biomedical and scientific research at Rutgers. Our university and the state have been active in the legal effort that led to the injunction, and we continue to work with our peer institutions, our congressional delegation, and other partners to advocate against this change.\n\nDespite the injunction, the university is aware that NIH councils are still not meeting, thus continuing to impede the funding of new grants. Also, the federal government has modified or terminated several active research awards at Rutgers, and the university continues to closely monitor the activities at federal funding agencies. Our Government Relations and Office for Research teams are calling for attention to these issues with our elected officials.\n\n\n\nInformation on the attorneys general’s guidance and on the NIH injunction can be found on the newly updated FAQ website related to federal affairs. I urge you to continue reaching out to your chancellor’s office and federal-tracking@rutgers.edu with any questions or concerns related to research and grants so that we can provide you with support and guidance.\n\n\n\nAmid the uncertainty of litigation, federal policy shifts, and changes among federal grant agencies, I also want to reiterate Rutgers’ commitment to its mission and its values. Our institution exists to educate students, conduct research that improves the world, and serve our communities. This mission is underpinned by commitments to academic freedom, freedom of expression, and an atmosphere free from discrimination.\n\n\n\nI thank you for all you do to support the university’s mission, its students, patients, and communities.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJonathan Holloway\n\nPresident and University Professor",

Harvard broadly beyond the admissions process. While additional legal guidance is expected, the Department has indicated that it will begin to assess compliance with the stated guidelines within 14 days.\n\nRutgers considers diversity to be necessary to foster the cultural competencies, resilience, and openness to dialogue that promote the intellectual growth and intergroup understanding that are essential for success in the classroom, the university community, and society at large. As we strive to foster a community where faculty, staff, and students from all backgrounds are able to thrive, we will review the Dear Colleague letter to ensure the university’s policies and practices continue to be consistent both with the law and with our institutional values.\n\nRutgers continues to monitor the impact and legal implications of all the federal executive actions that may affect our university community. We will also continue to work closely with our peer institutions in the Association of American Universities, the Big Ten, and other affiliated organizations, as well as with our elected representatives at the state and federal levels, to advocate for governmental policies that best enable higher education to perform its vital mission of education, research, and service to the common good.

    "content": "January 24, 2025\n\n\n\nMembers of the Administrative Council,\n\nIn recent days, the executive branch of the federal government has released a series of executive orders that have led to understandable questions, confusion, and concern from many in our community. These orders have included direction on immigration enforcement, federal funding, sex and gender definitions, and activities related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nIn all we do, Rutgers is guided by its public mission of teaching, research, and service. It is imperative as we work to understand the reach, legality, and impact of new federal rules that we as the university leadership stay focused on our core mission, that we support our students’ educational journey, and that we work together with open lines of communication.\n\nWe currently have no information that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is or will be on campus, nor do we have an expectation that we will receive advance notice if enforcement actions take place on or near campus. Rutgers protects the privacy of all our students and their records. We do not share student records unless required by law. Further, the Rutgers University Police Department does not ask for or document the immigration status of students or other persons unless a serious crime has been committed.\n\nRutgers is committed to ensuring that any federal enforcement actions on campus adhere to due process, including the requirement of a warrant when necessary. To support this, we encourage members of our community to contact RUPD if they become aware of any activity on campus.\n\nIn addition, we are working with our research community to assess the impact that federal agency pauses, including the pause on meetings, communications, and travel at the National Institutes of Health, may have on the research efforts underway at Rutgers. We will provide appropriate guidance to our research faculty and support staff as we learn more details.\n\nSeveral offices at the university have reported receiving stop work orders for activities funded by federal grants that have been deemed to relate to diversity, equity, and inclusion. If you know of or receive such orders directly, please share them immediately with federal-tracking@rutgers.edu and notify your chancellor’s office or the cabinet officer in your area.\n\nAs we seek to understand the evolving impact of the executive orders that target diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and programs, know we remain committed to building an inclusive community.\n\nFinally, I want to emphasize that we have resources available to our community. Through our law school, we have the Rutgers Immigrant Community Assistance Project (RICAP), which offers free, confidential legal consultations. Through Deans of Students offices on each campus, students can find resources and confidential guidance on questions related to immigration and more. In addition, students who are troubled or anxious about these federal directives have access to counseling professionals at the student health services locations on all our campuses.\n\nWith awareness that many constituencies at the university are navigating uncertainty around these executive orders, please share this message as you think appropriate.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonathan Holloway\n\nPresident and University Professor",

    "content": "January 16, 2025\n\nMembers of the Rutgers Community,\n\nAs the first day of classes for our undergraduates approaches, I want to welcome you back for what promises to be an exciting spring semester. Though the winter break is important for recharging our energy levels and connecting with loved ones, I’m also eager to see our campuses fill up again with the excitement of new courses, new students, and new discoveries—plus the anticipation of commencement exercises not far down the calendar.\n\nI have described Rutgers as a beloved community, and I want to reiterate that vision. A key strength of the university is the diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences that the members of our community bring to their work. We will not always agree on every issue, but we all deserve respect—every student, faculty member, and staff member—and we all have a vital role to play in the success of this institution.\n\nAs a public university, we remain deeply committed to our long-standing mission: to provide for the educational needs of New Jersey through our undergraduate, graduate, professional, and continuing education programs, to conduct cutting-edge research and clinical care that contributes to the well-being of the state, nation, and world, and to perform public service in support of the people of the state and the common good.\n\nIn carrying out that mission, we protect our students’ right to a Rutgers education—regardless of nationality, citizenship, political views, ancestry, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, veteran status, or socioeconomic status.\n\nDiscrimination is antithetical to education. Let me take this opportunity to reaffirm that Rutgers stands against harassment and discrimination in all its forms—including based on national origin, shared ancestry, and ethnic characteristics, including shared Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, or Muslim ancestry or association with these national origins and ancestries. The university will take all necessary steps within our control to address and ameliorate discrimination, and I encourage any student or employee who believes they have been subject to, or has information about, such discrimination to report it through their Dean of Students office or the Office of Employment Equity.\n\nWe also remain steadfast in our support of academic freedom and free speech. And we are committed to the success of our students, faculty, and staff in the pursuit of their goals and ambitions.\n\nThe start of our Spring 2025 semester coincides with the first week of a new Administration in Washington, D.C., and the potential for policy changes that could have a direct impact on our university and on our students, faculty, and staff. With that in mind, please be assured of our firm commitment to supporting this remarkable and diverse community of scholars.\n\nMy senior leadership team has been closely following the presidential transition and its implications for higher education, and we will communicate regarding federal policy changes that will have a significant impact on the Rutgers community. Just as important, we will make clear the various resources that the university has in place to assist and advocate for our students, faculty, and staff should the need arise.\n\nTo all our students arriving for the new semester, especially those joining Rutgers for the first time, I offer my fondest wishes for a productive, engaging, and rewarding spring semester.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonathan Holloway\n\nPresident and University Professor",

    "url": "https://www.rutgers.edu/president/regarding-the-recent-union-referendum",
    "content": "January 8, 2025\n\nDear Faculty Colleagues,\n\nRecently, the AAUP-AFT and the Adjunct Faculty Unions held a referendum among their members at Rutgers on whether the unions should advocate for the university to divest from companies that do business with Israel and for the university to sever its academic partnership with Tel Aviv University.\n\nMany have expressed concerns about the chilling effect this referendum may have on the scholarship of faculty members who conduct their research on Israel, partner with Israel, are Israeli themselves, or identify deeply with Israel. In response to these concerns, I want to offer a few comments.\n\nThe university maintains a policy on investments by which members of the community may propose divestment to our governing boards. A proposal seeking divestment from Israel was submitted last spring and, after review in accordance with the process outlined in our Policy on Investments, it did not move forward. That decision still stands.\n\nWhile I have no role in how the university’s endowment is invested, I have said publicly many times that I believe in engagement, not isolation.\n\nThe unions may choose to take positions as organizations and to advocate for them, but there are central aspects of the university’s academic mission where, I want to be clear, Rutgers will not deviate.\n\nRegarding academic partnerships, it is a point of pride that Rutgers faculty interact with scholars and universities in nations around the world. The breadth of our partnerships is among our university’s great strengths. Moreover, Rutgers faculty come from around the world, and we are richer as a community for this diversity of experiences and perspectives.\n\nPerhaps most important for me to emphasize is this: our academic community seeks to support all faculty in the teaching, research, and service they bring to the university. Our policies and processes for the recruitment, appointment, and advancement of faculty do not consider political views, race, religion, shared ancestry, gender, or any other personal attributes. The university steadfastly prohibits unlawful discrimination.\n\nFinally, I reiterate that Rutgers maintains its profound and essential commitment to academic freedom: the right of our faculty, in the discharge of their duties, to express their ideas and to challenge the ideas of others without fear of retribution is the core tenet of our identity as a scholarly community. The university will not waver on this commitment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonathan Holloway\n\nPresident and University Professor",

NBCOT also works with state regulators and employers to provide information on credentials, professional conduct and regulatory issues. NBCOT’s certification programs have received and maintained accreditation from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).\n\nAbout Rockland Community College, State University of New York\n\nRockland Community College, State University of New York, offers a safe, supportive learning environment for thousands of students who appreciate small class sizes and personal attention from a distinguished, award-winning faculty that includes Fulbright scholars and SUNY Distinguished Professors.

The keynote speaker will be Crismelly Morales, an immigration attorney and RCC graduate. Her passion for immigration law is deeply personal—she immigrated from the Dominican Republic and understands firsthand the challenges and hopes of pursuing the American dream. She has since built a career championing the rights of immigrants.\n\nA proud graduate of Rockland Community College, Morales earned an A.A.S. in Paralegal Studies and was recognized with the Hispanic Heritage Award for Academic Excellence. She went on to earn her B.A. from SUNY Purchase and her J.D. from New York Law School. In 2023, she returned to RCC as an adjunct professor and now serves on the Legal Studies Program advisory committee. In her law practice she focuses on family-based immigration, humanitarian relief, and non-detained removal defense. Morales is an active member of the legal community, serving on the boards of the Rockland County Women’s Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Rockland County, and co-chairing the Immigration Law Committee of the Rockland County Bar Association. As keynote speaker, she returns to RCC to inspire graduates to pursue their goals with courage, resilience, and purpose.\n\n“We are incredibly proud to welcome Crismelly Morales back to Rockland Community College as our 2025 Commencement keynote speaker,” said Dr. Scott J. Kalicki, Officer in Charge. “Her story is a powerful example of what our students can achieve through perseverance, purpose, and the transformative power of education. As an RCC alumna, an immigration attorney, and a passionate advocate for justice, Crismelly embodies the values we hope to instill in every graduate. Her voice will undoubtedly inspire our students as they prepare to embark on the next chapter of their journeys.”\n\nDuring the ceremony, the 2025 SUNY Chancellor’s Award for Excellence recipients will be honored. This year, two students and one staff member received the prestigious recognition:\n\nSUNY Chancellor’s Award for Student Excellence – Rhishma Ashton\n\nRhishma Ashton is a proud December graduate of Rockland Community College and a newly registered nurse. Rhishma began her journey at RCC during the post-COVID era, a time when remote learning left many students feeling disconnected. Motivated by a desire to foster community and belonging, she set out to ensure her peers felt supported, welcomed, and seen. That mission guided her throughout her time at RCC and informed her many contributions to student life. She served in multiple leadership roles, including Student Ambassador in the Admissions Office, Peer Mentor for the Somos El Futuro program, Orientation Leader, and Chair of the Student Activities Board within the Student Involvement Department. She also served as a Student Government Senator and was actively involved with both the National Society of Leadership and Success and the President’s Society.\n\nSUNY Chancellor’s Award for Student Excellence– Ronny Sanchez\n\nRonny Sanchez is currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Rockland Community College. An active and engaged member of the campus community, Ronny has served in key leadership roles within the Student Government Association, including Treasurer and Vice President. He has also contributed to student success as a Peer Mentor for the Somos El Futuro program, where he provided guidance and support to fellow students throughout their academic journeys. In addition to his academic and leadership accomplishments, Ronny is passionate about music and the performing arts. He has hosted several open mic events and performed in various concerts on campus, enriching the college’s cultural and creative landscape.\n\nSUNY Chancellor’s Award for Professional Service – Susanna Santiago\n\nSusanna Santiago, M.S., MHC-LP, leads the Somos El Futuro program at Rockland Community College, where she oversees DEI initiatives, student success programs, and cultural events that promote belonging and academic achievement. She holds a Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling and began her journey at RCC as a mental health counseling intern. A strong advocate for Applied Learning opportunities, Susanna believes in giving students hands-on, transformative experiences. She created the First-Generation Ceremony to celebrate students breaking barriers and leads the Somos Peer Mentoring Program to support academic and personal growth. Known for her strategic collaboration with faculty and staff and her data-informed approach, she is committed to advancing inclusive excellence and empowering historically underrepresented students. She currently serves as Chair of Steps Beyond Statements (the College’s Diversity Committee) and Co-Chair of Commencement, the First-Generation Ceremony, and Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\nVisit sunyrockland.edu/commencement to watch the livestream of the ceremony on Monday, May 19, 2025, at 11:00 am if you unable to attend in person.\n\nFor more information about Rockland Community College visit sunyrockland.edu or follow on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more: sunyrockland.edu/socialmedia.\n\nAbout Rockland Community College\n\nRockland Community College (RCC), located in Suffern, New York, provides purpose-driven educational opportunities in a supportive, affordable, and accessible environment, empowering individuals to positively transform themselves and their communities.

This year, RCC is celebrating its long-standing passion for chess with its 35th Annual Chess Event and Exhibition, featuring a special appearance by International Grandmaster Gennady Sagalchik.\n\nThe event will take place Thursday, April 3, at 12:30 PM in the Student Union, Room 3214 on RCC’s main campus in Suffern, NY. Open to all RCC students, employees, and community members, the tournament is also welcoming three student representatives from each Rockland County school district to participate.\n\n“Over the past thirty-four years, the Annual Chess Event and Exhibition has become a highlight of campus life. Students eagerly await the opportunity to express their love and passion for chess with International Grandmaster Gennady Sagalchik. He offers them an experience that they will remember for the rest of their lives,” said Peter Arvanites, Faculty Advisor for the Chess Club and Professor of Mathematics at RCC.\n\nFor RCC’s Chess Club, this event is the Super Bowl of Chess. Attendees will have the chance to meet and even challenge International Grandmaster Gennady Sagalchik, a Belarus-born chess champion and one of the country’s top chess coaches. A three-time Pan-American Intercollegiate Champion, he played a key role in leading the teams of Manhattan Community College and Brooklyn College to victory. He was also a 2002 U.S. Championship participant and has earned top prizes in international tournaments.\n\nNow based in Brooklyn, Grandmaster Sagalchik works with more than 350 students and serves as the head coach for Chess Mates, a rapidly growing scholastic chess organization on Long Island.\n\nFor RCC students, chess is more than a pastime—it’s a mindset.\n\n“I am looking forward to an engaging match with International Grandmaster Gennady Sagalchik, as well as seeing how the members of Chess Club improved throughout the year,” said Yehuda Choen, President of RCC’s Chess Club.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned player or just learning the rules, there’s a seat at the board for everyone.\n\nPlease contact Peter Arvanites, Professor of Mathematics, at 845-574-4767 or [email protected] for more information.\n\nAbout Rockland Community College, State University of New York\n\nRockland Community College (RCC), located in Suffern New York, provides purpose driven educational opportunities in a supportive, affordable, and accessible environment, empowering individuals to positively transform themselves and their communities.

    "content": "National program will provide campus administrators training and resources to create an inclusive and safe environment for Jewish students\n\n(ROCKLAND COUNTY, NY) January 29, 2025 — As part of Rockland Community College’s (RCC) ongoing commitment to maintaining an inclusive campus community for all students, faculty, and staff, the college today announced its participation in Hillel International’s Campus Climate Initiative (CCI). CCI provides senior campus administrators with a comprehensive program to foster a campus climate in which Jewish students feel comfortable expressing their identity free of antisemitism, harassment, or marginalization.\n\nCCI’s program provides campuses with tools to assess their current campus climate and a 10-month educational curriculum through which to explore Jewish student experiences on campus. Following its completion of the program in December 2025, RCC administrators will develop and implement a data-informed Campus Action Plan to create a more inclusive campus climate for all students.\n\n“Joining Hillel International’s Campus Climate Initiative is a significant step in our ongoing efforts to address antisemitism and ensure inclusivity,” said Melissa L. Roy, JD, RCC’s Chief Diversity Officer. “Through this partnership, we are equipping our leadership with the tools and education needed to create a safer, more welcoming space for Jewish students and the entire campus community.”\n\n“I’m pleased to see that the college is taking a proactive stance in combating antisemitism by joining the Hillel Campus Climate Initiative,” said New York State Assemblymember Aron Wieder. “Now more than ever, it is crucial to demonstrate that hate has no place anywhere, especially on college campuses.”\n\nRCC offers a vibrant and active campus community, providing students with opportunities to expand their horizons beyond the classroom. In the Fall of 2024, the college offered more than 40 clubs and organizations that focus on career development, cultural exploration, and fostering lifelong friendships. These include religious life clubs and organizations that offer guidance, leadership, and relevant programs to students of diverse traditions. Additionally, RCC provides a private prayer, meditation, and reflection space on campus for students of all religious backgrounds.\n\nIn partnering with Hillel International on CCI, RCC joins approximately 20 campuses across the country, small and large, public and private in this cohort – and 75 campuses over the last 5 cohorts – that all share a commitment to combating antisemitism through effective, meaningful partnership and education. More information about CCI and participating colleges and universities can be found on the Hillel website.\n\nFor information of RCC’s commitment to creating an inclusive campus community, please visit the campus Student Involvement and Diversity websites.\n\nAbout Rockland Community College, State University of New York\n\nRockland Community College (RCC), located in Suffern New York, provides purpose driven educational opportunities in a supportive, affordable, and accessible environment, empowering individuals to positively transform themselves and their communities.

    "content": "Tuesday, April 29, 2025 email from President Sarah Bolton to campus with an update on work to support and protect international students and colleagues:\n\nDear Whitman Community,\n\nI provide an update on our work to support and protect international students and colleagues, as well as students and colleagues with DACA status and others who are not US citizens, as we see rapid changes in federal policies and actions related to visas, SEVIS status, and immigration enforcement.\n\nWhitman College is extremely fortunate to have students, faculty and staff from across the country and around the world. The contributions of these members of our community are crucial to making Whitman a strong college and an excellent place for students to learn, grow and prepare for their futures. Whether born inside or outside the United States, all should be able to learn, work and thrive on our campus with confidence, knowing they are safe.\n\nThe College is absolutely committed to protecting and supporting international and other non-citizen members of our community to the fullest extent possible under the law. ASWC passed a resolution last week calling for the College to adopt practices associated with sanctuary. Because sanctuary can mean different things to different people, and providing the most accurate possible information is crucial to the safety of individuals affected by these policies, we are sharing updates on Whitman’s work here.\n\nThe college and all of its staff will protect students’ and employees’ safety and privacy to the maximum possible extent under the law. No college staff member will provide any information on students or employees to ICE or other outside agents unless we are absolutely required to do so by a legal order, such as a signed judicial warrant. If someone comes to campus seeking a student or employee, we would not provide them any information or access to non-public spaces unless they have a signed judicial warrant from a judge that requires us to do so. If the agent has a signed judicial warrant, we would work with our attorneys to see whether there are legal grounds to object to the warrant or to require that it be narrowed in scope. As Dean Joshua shared several weeks ago, we have developed more specific guidance for those who may be interested in additional details, which can be found here. It is based on best practices developed by a number of legal efforts supporting the rights of immigrants and others who are not US citizens.\n\n\n\nIf a student or employee has their visa revoked or SEVIS status terminated, or is approached or detained by ICE or other federal agents, we will immediately connect the student or employee with expert legal assistance to help them and can provide some financial assistance and other support. We have brought expert immigration attorneys to campus several times, to work with students and employees and provide information and guidance, and will continue to provide resources as needs evolve.\n\nWe are making plans for students who may unexpectedly need to stay on campus this summer due to visa or immigration concerns, and the Dean of Students’ office is collaborating with Cody Tornow, Director of International Student and Scholar Services and others, to make sure we have provisions for housing, food, employment, wellness and other support. International students with questions about the summer should contact Cody Tornow to talk through their options and what may work best for them.\n\nWhitman staff are working with a number of organizations (Presidents’ Alliance on Immigration and Higher education, National Association of International Educators, American Council on Education, and others) to track the evolving situation and provide the best available guidance to the community. We are also working with these organizations to advocate for the rights of our students and colleagues at the state and federal levels, and to weigh in through amicus briefs in court cases.\n\nI am deeply grateful for our global community, and for the care shown across our college to ensure that we are providing the best support to those who may need it in a time of changing federal practices. Many people have been involved in the work to provide this support, but my special thanks go to Director of International Student and Scholar Services Cody Tornow, Dean Kazi Joshua, Chief of Staff Maggie Eaheart, Director of Residential Life Andrew Padilla Johnson, AVP of Wellness Aimée Milne, Assistant Director for Faculty Human Resources Atarah Pinder, AVP of Human Resources Erika Cerda, Bon Appetit Manager Shannon Null and the teams in the Offices of Communications, Provost and Dean of Faculty, Student Affairs, Business and Administration and Inclusive Excellence for their deep commitment and extensive work to rapidly create these supportive programs. We will continue this work and will keep you updated.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Bolton",

I received several questions today regarding whether or not the private security officer that was present at Memorial last night was armed.\n\nI want to be really transparent that last night the officer was, in fact, armed. While that is the practice of the company, that was not the intention when the college asked for their assistance. In fact, it is against college policy for anyone other than sworn law enforcement officers in the course of their duties to carry firearms on campus. For that reason, we have required that, moving forward, any security officers coming onto Whitman’s campus be unarmed. The company has committed to that practice.\n\nI want to assure the community that moving forward, and consistent with our policies, we will not have armed private security officers on campus from any company.\n\nIt is also important to reiterate that the role of the security officers from the outside company is to keep watch and to call Whitman Campus Security if anything arises. They are not intended to engage with students or others on campus in the course of their work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Bolton",

A security company was asked to provide extra support to Whitman Security staff in response to concerns about an increased risk of vandalism to Memorial Building. The company is the same one that has been working with Whitman since October, when they were hired to maintain an increased security presence on Isaacs to ensure the safety of our students after shots were fired in the area of two fraternities.\n\nYesterday, the company was asked to provide a security officer to help the on-duty Whitman Security staff. The sole role the staff from the outside company were instructed to undertake was to watch Mem and call Whitman Campus Security if they observed vandalism or other concerns taking place. (It’s important to note here that chalking on and around the Mem steps, as has been taking place frequently, is not vandalism. Vandalism would include actions that cause damage, like throwing or spraying paint, which has taken place several times and has also been threatened again recently.)\n\nI realize that any unexplained and unfamiliar security presence on campus can be very alarming to many of our community members during the current uncertain times, especially as troubling immigration actions against international students and faculty have been so widespread across the United States. I want to express my sincere apologies for bringing in this contract company to assist without communicating about it to the campus in advance, and for the fear that the unexpected presence of outside security may have caused to members of our community.\n\nThe safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority, and moving forward we will be especially attentive to how we communicate about external security presence on campus to ensure that we are not creating fear or uncertainty through a lack of information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Bolton",

    "content": "Tuesday, April 15, 2025 email from President Sarah Bolton to campus regarding recent chalking on campus:\n\nDear members of the Whitman Community,\n\nIn the past two weeks we have seen a significant uptick in the frequency and number of chalked messages around campus, both by members of our own community and by members of the Walla Walla community. In some cases, the messages of the chalkings are in direct opposition to our values of inclusivity. Our intent is to support free expression and to be a welcoming and equitable campus where all members feel like they belong. As we all know, bringing together these two ideals can be challenging, and it is in this instance. We do not wish to engage in viewpoint discrimination. In addition, we cannot clearly distinguish between messages written by members of the Whitman College community and those outside of it, and it is not feasible for our staff to proactively review each of the many messages rapidly appearing all over campus to assess which may be of significant concern to individuals or communities. For all of these reasons, we have asked Facilities Services to routinely clean sidewalk and other surfaces and regularly remove chalkings around campus for the remainder of the semester, regardless of the content of the chalked messages or who has created them.\n\nThis shift in practice does not prohibit the use of chalking as a form of expression on campus. People are free and welcome to chalk. However, we cannot guarantee that chalked messages will remain for extended periods of time.\n\nI acknowledge that this approach is likely imperfect and may raise concerns for those who have used chalking as a primary means of communication as well as those who might wish to see certain messages stay while others are removed. As we look forward to next year, we may engage in some additional discussion with the community about how best to meet the dual goals of free expression and a fully welcoming and equitable community that is free of harassment, in the context of anonymous public messaging such as chalking, which becomes an impactful part of the living and working landscape of everyone on campus.\n\nAs a reminder, chalking on vertical surfaces (other than chalkboards) is never allowed. Chalkings that publicly target individual members of the community by name are also not allowed as they could be considered intimidation or harassment, depending on the context.\n\nEvery member of the Whitman Community has the right to feel safe and welcome on campus and we all share the responsibility for maintaining a campus atmosphere that encourages open discourse and freedom of expression while also being conducive to teaching, studying, learning and working. I am grateful to all those thinking through these complex issues, and look forward to our continued work together and to celebrating the accomplishments of our students, faculty and staff as the semester draws to a close.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Bolton",

    "content": "Monday, March 11, 2025 email from President Sarah Bolton to campus regarding recent media reports concerning an OCR investigation:\n\n\n\nDear Members of the Whitman Community,\n\nMany of you have likely heard that on Monday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) sent letters to 60 institutions of higher education who have been under investigation for alleged Title VI violations relating to actions and climate on campuses. Whitman College was one of the schools on that list. Based on what has been communicated to us thus far, this announcement does not appear to reflect a new investigation. Rather, it stems from a complaint issued in late 2023 and shared with campus at that time. The notice we received in December, 2023, alleged that the College “failed to respond to incidents of harassment on campus based on national origin (shared Jewish ancestry)”. Whitman College has cooperated fully with the investigation, but we have not yet been informed of its outcome. The College has also continued to strengthen our already significant work combating antisemitism and bias of any kind.\n\nThe letter we received yesterday from the OCR does not offer any new information regarding the investigation or its conclusions. Rather, it reminds us of our legal obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which we are fully committed to uphold.\n\nI would like to take this moment to once again stress that Whitman College is absolutely committed to combating bias of any kind and to ensuring all members of our community have equitable and uninterrupted access to the educational opportunities we provide, free of harassment or discrimination. The safety of all students, staff and faculty is our top priority and we will continue to do what is necessary to make our campus welcoming to all.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Bolton",

    "content": "Friday, Jan. 17, 2025 email from President Sarah Bolton to campus regarding Whitman College’s continued commitment to priniciples of inclusive excellence:\n\nDear Whitman Students and Colleagues,\n\nWelcome to the spring semester! I hope that your winter holidays were good ones and that you are having a good start to 2025.\n\nI’m writing today to reaffirm our strong commitment to inclusive excellence in the Whitman community. The diversity of identities, nationalities, cultures, and experiences on our campus is crucial to our mission of learning. Every person in this community has the right to an excellent and equitable experience of true welcome, safety, and belonging. These are central values for our college, and we will continue to work to fully realize them.\n\nWhitman College’s non-discrimination policy makes clear that the College stands against discrimination in all its forms. And, it lays out specifically that the college does not tolerate discrimination on the basis of “race, color, sex (including pregnancy and parenting status), gender, gender identity or expression, genetic information, sexual orientation, religion, age, marital status, national origin, shared ancestry, disability or veteran status”. Recently, there have been concerns about whether Federal law will continue to protect individuals from discrimination on the basis of all of these dimensions of identity. I want to be clear that, regardless of any change in Federal protections, our college has authority over our own non-discrimination policy, and we will continue to uphold the full range of protections from discrimination for all members of the Whitman community.\n\nAs we enter a time of possible changes to US Immigration policies and practices, we also want to take special care to support those members of our community who are most affected by those policies—especially those who do not hold US citizenship or who are concerned about family members who do not hold US citizenship. We have been in touch with international and undocumented students to provide information and resources, and have also reached out with supportive resources for those who may be concerned about family members. As a reminder, representatives from Colectiva Legal del Pueblo will be on campus February 21st to provide our community with information about their rights and help us enhance institutional support strategies. We will continue to provide new resources and information as they become available.\n\nInternational and undocumented members of our community may have special needs or concerns in the coming months, and we want to be sure that you have the support and resources that are most helpful to you. For undocumented students or students concerned about undocumented family members, Dean Kazi Joshua will serve as a point person. Because we don’t share information about undocumented status with anyone on campus, students should reach out directly to Dean Joshua if they’d like to talk about these concerns. For international students and scholars, the point person will be Susan Holme, Senior Director, Off-Campus Studies & International Student and Scholar Services. Employees who are concerned about family members who are undocumented can talk with Erika Cerda, Associate Vice President of Human Resources.\n\nFinally, we remind all of the campus community to be attentive to privacy of personal information and the rights of all persons under the law. In particular, we will maintain our current practice of ensuring the confidentiality of all student and employee records and will not provide private information about Whitman students or employees to any external group without a valid warrant or court order. Anyone who is asked by an external person for information about a student or employee should be referred to the Office of the Dean of Students (for students) or to the Office of Human Resources (for employees). If there is a need for assistance after hours, or a request that appears to be coming from police, please reach out to the Director of Campus Security, Greg Powell (509-527-5777). The staff in all of these offices are prepared to assess such requests and to determine the appropriate course of action to protect individual privacy and uphold the law.\n\nI am looking forward very much to the semester, and to the ways we will work and learn together. As we do so, I am grateful to each of you for your steadfast commitment to creating a Whitman where all can thrive and flourish.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Bolton",

    "content": "This statement was developed in collaboration with university and college presidents and other educational leaders across the country, after national meetings convened by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.\n\nAs leaders of America’s colleges, universities, and scholarly societies, we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education. We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight. However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.\n\nAmerica’s system of higher learning is as varied as the goals and dreams of the students it serves. It includes research universities and community colleges; comprehensive universities and liberal arts colleges; public institutions and private ones; freestanding and multi-site campuses. Some institutions are designed for all students, and others are dedicated to serving particular groups. Yet, American institutions of higher learning have in common the essential freedom to determine, on academic grounds, whom to admit and what is taught, how, and by whom. Our colleges and universities share a commitment to serve as centers of open inquiry where, in their pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation.\n\nBecause of these freedoms, American institutions of higher learning are essential to American prosperity and serve as productive partners with government in promoting the common good. Colleges and universities are engines of opportunity and mobility, anchor institutions that contribute to economic and cultural vitality regionally and in our local communities. They foster creativity and innovation, provide human resources to meet the fast-changing demands of our dynamic workforce, and are themselves major employers. They nurture the scholarly pursuits that ensure America’s leadership in research, and many provide healthcare and other essential services. Most fundamentally, America’s colleges and universities prepare an educated citizenry to sustain our democracy.\n\nThe price of abridging the defining freedoms of American higher education will be paid by our students and our society. On behalf of our current and future students, and all who work at and benefit from our institutions, we call for constructive engagement that improves our institutions and serves our republic.\n\nSigned,\n\nAndrés Acebo, Interim President, New Jersey City University\n\nSalvador D.

    "content": "The following message was sent by President Ana Mari Cauce, Provost Tricia Serio and Vice President and Chief Compliance and Risk Officer Jane Yung to faculty, staff and academic personnel across the University of Washington on Thursday, May 15, 2025.\n\nDear UW Community,\n\nThe University of Washington is dedicated to fostering a community that ensures equal access; prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, ethnicity and ancestry; and is welcoming to all so that we can learn, work and live together in safety and dignity. To that end, we are writing to provide you with education and information about Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Please take the time to review this important message.\n\nAs we said in our announcement on Jan. 15, 2025, the University has been actively taking steps, including those outlined below, to satisfy its obligations under the resolution agreement with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights and strengthen its Title VI compliance.\n\nTitle VI education and resources\n\nWe encourage all students and employees to visit our new Title VI Information and Education webpage, which is designed to educate employees and students about the protections offered under Title VI and the University’s responsibilities. The page includes:\n\nKey definitions and examples of conduct that may violate Title VI\n\nInformation on how the UW addresses reports and supports those impacted\n\nScenarios involving both on- and off-campus or online conduct that could create a hostile environment\n\nTitle VI protections apply to discrimination or harassment based on actual or perceived:\n\nRace or national origin–related physical traits\n\nSkin color or complexion\n\nAncestral country or region\n\nLimited English proficiency or English learner status\n\nShared ethnic or ancestral background\n\nThese protections extend to behavior that occurs off campus or online if it limits an individual’s ability to participate in UW programs or activities.\n\nReporting and response\n\nInformation about how to make a report can be found on the Make a Report webpage. Retaliation for filing a report or participating in related processes is strictly prohibited under Title VI and University policy.\n\nWhen a report is received, the UW will:\n\nReview the report and assess any immediate safety concerns\n\nIdentify appropriate response options\n\nContact the impacted individual (if disclosed) to offer support and resources\n\nEvaluate whether a hostile environment may have been created and take necessary action\n\nCampus Climate Survey\n\nIf you have not already done so, please take a few minutes to complete the Campus Climate Survey by May 22, which now includes questions about the University’s climate relating to race, color, national origin, ethnicity and ancestry. Your input will help the University better understand and improve the climate around these and other issues.\n\nCivil Rights Compliance Office\n\nEffective July 2025, the UW will launch a newly consolidated Civil Rights Compliance Office within Compliance and Risk Services. This office will house the Title IX and ADA Coordinators, as well as the investigations and case management team. It will also include a Title VI Coordinator, who will oversee Title VI compliance and support broader civil rights initiatives. This role reflects the University’s ongoing commitment to equitable access to education and employment, and to preventing and addressing discrimination and harassment.\n\nThis work depends on all of us, so we thank you for doing your part to contribute to a safe, welcoming and respectful environment at the UW.",

    "content": "The following message was sent to all students, staff, faculty and academic personnel at the University of Washington’s Seattle campus.\n\nDear UW community,\n\nLate yesterday afternoon, a group identifying themselves as the suspended student organization SUPER UW posted on social media that they were occupying the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building on the Seattle campus and asked for other groups to join them. These groups temporarily occupied and vandalized the building before being arrested by law enforcement officers from UWPD, the Seattle Police Department and the Washington State Patrol. They also set fire to dumpsters in a nearby street after blocking exits in the IEB and blocking nearby streets to delay firefighters’ access.\n\nThis was no peaceful protest in support of Palestinian rights or against the war in Gaza. I condemn this dangerous, violent and illegal building occupation and related vandalism. I also condemn in the strongest terms the group’s statement celebrating the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. The University will not be intimidated by this sort of horrific and destructive behavior and will not engage in dialogue with any group using or condoning such destructive tactics. We will continue our actions to oppose antisemitism, racism and all forms of biases so that ALL our students, faculty, staff and visitors can feel safe and welcome on our campuses.\n\nKing County jail staff are working to identify the roughly 30 people who were arrested, so at the moment we do not know how many are UW students or community members. We are working with law enforcement and through our own disciplinary processes to ensure those responsible face appropriate consequences for their actions. And we will continue to stand strong against violent and illegal activities that create a hostile environment for any and all members of our community. I want to thank the members of UWPD and our law enforcement partners for their assistance in bringing this situation to a swift resolution.",

    "content": "The following message was sent by President Cauce to all UW faculty, staff and academic personnel on Tuesday, April 29, 2025.\n\nOver the past several weeks and months, there have been many questions about how the University of Washington is dealing with federal government actions that affect research funding and/or represent unwarranted and constitutionally questionable intrusions into our ability to educate students, care for patients and conduct research. At the same time, there have been a range of opinions expressed about how we and other universities should be responding to these threats.\n\nWe are actively responding on several fronts, many of which Provost Serio and I discussed in our April 3 message to the UW community and/or are outlined on the Federal Policy Updates page. Today, I’d like to focus on how the UW is acting in concert with its partners to respond to the ongoing effort to upend the decades-old partnership between universities and the federal government — a partnership that has made the United States healthier, safer and more prosperous.\n\nThe UW is engaged in a range of collective conversations and efforts, including through the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA), Association of American Universities (AAU), Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU) and American Council on Education (ACE). These groups regularly bring together university presidents, provosts, vice provosts for research, chief financial officers, communications and federal relations leads, diversity officers, vice presidents for student life, deans of medicine and CEOs of university hospitals, and attorneys general and chief counsels, among others, to share information and discuss strategies for engagement and/or responses to federal actions. We have also been meeting at least weekly — and more often several times a week — with subgroups of these same key leaders to discuss how federal actions are affecting us, and how to best mitigate any negative effects. For example, we are involved in a nationwide effort to propose a simpler format for reimbursement of indirect costs of research.\n\nAdditionally, I, UW Bothell Chancellor Kristin Esterberg, UW Tacoma Chancellor Sheila Edwards Lange and nearly 500 of our colleagues from community and technical colleges, public and private liberal arts colleges, and research universities around the country signed a letter criticizing unwarranted federal intrusions and calling for more constructive engagement. As we said in the letter, we are open to constructive reform and support legitimate government oversight. But we must resist unwarranted government intrusion and the coercive use of public research funding.\n\nIn partnership with the Washington state Attorney General’s Office, we have also been working closely with colleagues in AAU, APLU and ACE to push back in the courts against federal actions that endanger our missions. We have also assisted in legal challenges against the threat to deport students and faculty for lawful speech and to action by the Department of Energy to arbitrarily cut funding rates.\n\nWe have also been instrumental in supporting affirmative litigation brought by Washington state, filing numerous declarations in support of lawsuits to protect the UW and others. When Washington state sued the federal government to keep the National Institutes of Health from capping indirect cost rates, the UW provided critical information enabling the court to enter an injunction to keep the change from being implemented. The UW has similarly supported lawsuits to halt attempts to freeze federal grants and funding that contain elements related to diversity, equity and inclusion; to halt delays in reviewing and renewing NIH grant funding; and to halt the dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, among others. Most recently, as part of the UW’s efforts to support international students affected by the federal government’s arbitrary revocation of some students’ immigration status, the UW supplied key declarations to support litigation that saw the federal government enjoined and forced to reverse its actions.\n\nAs these and other actions are challenged, we are using a range of mechanisms to support faculty, staff and students, including those who are funded by grants that have been delayed or canceled. As Provost Serio and I wrote earlier in April, that includes the University taking the risk of allowing departments to authorize advanced spending for 30 days on grants that are pending renewal or extension. But as we also noted, our ability to backstop federal funding is very limited. No source of money available to the UW — public or private — can possibly replace more than a small fraction of the more than $1.2 billion in federally funded research we conducted last fiscal year alone.\n\nIn addition, while we closely monitor communications from the U.S. President and federal agencies, we are not taking preemptive action that we believe would not benefit — or would even run counter to — our mission. For example, we are not preemptively eliminating our diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs. We do and will, of course, continue to follow all federal laws. Our programs to support the success of all students and employees operate in a manner consistent with current federal law, and we routinely audit programs to ensure this, as well as responding to complaints when they are made.\n\nThis is unquestionably a very difficult time with an unprecedented amount of uncertainty, lack of clarity in communications from the federal government, constantly changing grant and contract reporting requirements, and reporting on social media and in news reports that add to anxiety and confusion. For example, there have been reports in the press that we cannot accept NIH funding unless we eliminate our diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The UW’s programs are fully compliant with federal and state law, and we continue to accept NIH funding as such. The federal administration may wish to change the law, but it has not succeeded in doing so yet.\n\nFinally, I want to thank members of our congressional delegation, led by Sen. Patty Murray and Sen. Maria Cantwell, for their steadfast support of the University and our students and scholars. We are fortunate to have advocates like them and the members of our U.S. House delegation representing our state in Washington, D.C. We will also continue to post regular updates on the Provost’s Office Federal Policy Updates page, including regarding student visas and the support the University is providing to international students and scholars.\n\nOur approach will continue to be to monitor the federal landscape as it affects us, to be in close communication with our peers and colleagues, and to focus our response and efforts using those channels that we believe will be most effective in protecting and furthering our ability to carry out our mission on behalf of our students, patients and the people we serve.",

    "content": "The following message was sent by President Cauce and Provost Serio to all UW faculty, staff and academic personnel on Thursday, April 3, 2025.\n\n\n\nOver the past two months, we have been tracking and responding to a range of policy changes and directives from the federal government while also facing major state budget cuts. Combined they create a perfect storm that we must continue to actively address.\n\nAs we navigate these and future challenges, we will be guided by our mission of expanding access to an excellent education and to serving the public good, as well as our University’s values. And we will continue to prioritize the well-being of our students, patients, faculty and other academic personnel, and staff as we make decisions.\n\nBudgetary impacts\n\nFederal impacts: As a major research university with a large health-care mission, the cancellation of grants and continued delays in annual award notices and renewals threaten our ability to fund and educate our graduate students, provide our undergraduates with important research experiences, and innovate. They also threaten our ability to provide our patients with leading-edge care in the present and develop and test new life-saving treatments and cures for the future.\n\nOn each of these issues, UW leaders, the Office of Federal Relations and the Washington Attorney General’s Office have been working with a range of partners, including higher education associations, UW supporters, and policymakers from Washington and other states to protect our ability to fulfill the UW’s mission. We have been successful in several areas, as court orders have blocked some of the most damaging proposals, at least for the time being. Additionally, this week a presidential message was sent to UW alumni living in other states to alert them to these challenges and urge them to join in our efforts to let others know the high societal cost of such draconian cuts to federal research.\n\nAs we navigate the ever-changing federal landscape, we are also working with principal investigators and other research leaders to mitigate the effects to the extent we can. That includes taking the risk of allowing advanced spending for 30 days on grants that are pending renewal. However, no source of money available to the University — public or private — can possibly replace more than a small fraction of the more than $1.2 billion in federally funded research we conducted last fiscal year alone. We must prepare for the long-term impacts of these federal policy changes.\n\nState impacts: At the state level, the Washington House and Senate majorities’ proposed budgets disproportionately affect the state’s four-year universities and would impose especially damaging cuts on the UW. We recognize the state government is facing budget challenges that Governor Ferguson described as a “five-alarm fire,” and we are committed to doing our part. But the effects of these proposals on our ability to educate students and serve our state are profound.\n\nIn short, both chambers are considering measures that would cut the UW’s funding across the board, as well as reduce the amount and share of money provided for compensation increases. In addition, they raise the costs the UW pays for health insurance and other benefits.\n\nCombined, these and other proposals would have major negative impacts on our students. Not only would they and their families be expected to pay more, but with cuts of this magnitude, we simply would not be able to provide students with the same level of educational excellence. These effects would ripple across the state and beyond for years and decades to come, as we still have not fully recovered from the state funding cuts of the Great Recession, and these proposed reductions would set us back again.\n\nPresident Cauce will continue to travel to Olympia to meet with legislators, and Office of State Relations representatives are there daily. She has also written to UW alumni living in Washington to inform them of the situation and how they can get updates via UW Impact, a program of the UW Alumni Association.\n\nWith your help, and that of our aluhttps://uwimpact.org/join/mni and supporters, we will continue to make the case for the importance of research funding at the federal level and push back against inequitable cuts by the state. Still, there is no question that our budget will be challenged in the upcoming biennium, with the University’s expenses already stretched thin before the current crisis.\n\nYour continued efforts to reduce expenses are vital. Every dollar that goes to expenses that are non-essential now worsens the financial situation and will require deeper cuts later, putting not only new, but existing programs at risk. We must spend less to sustain the University’s mission through these uncertain times and ensure a healthier future for generations to come.\n\nCommitment to our mission and values\n\nIn addition to the budgetary perfect storm, with state shortfalls magnifying federal cutbacks, many of us are deeply concerned about a range of other federal policies that impact our ability to provide an open, welcoming and supportive environment for ALL of our students, faculty and staff.\n\nWe do not view diversity and access as being in opposition to merit and excellence, and we remain committed to providing access to excellence for all. We are not mandating any preemptive changes in our policies as we already follow all state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Part of that compliance is ensuring that the members of our University are aware of their responsibilities. For example, in conjunction with state and federal requirements, we’ve expanded trainings on shared ancestry, race and sex discrimination for students, faculty and staff. Also, our five-year Campus Climate Survey will launch this spring to help guide further leadership actions. We hope everyone will participate to ensure the University remains a welcoming place for all. Our programs and services are open to all, and we engage in periodic reviews of our programs and activities using guidance from UW Compliance and Risk Services.\n\nThe UW is committed to welcoming students and employees with a diversity of experiences and viewpoints. Freedom of expression is core to the university experience and to American ideals, and we support the right to free speech across the spectrum of political and ideological positions. At the same time, as we have made very clear, we will enforce laws and policies against harassment, creating a hostile environment and disrupting University activities and operations. We also fully support our faculty and instructors’ right to academic freedom, including in their research and in the classroom, while reminding all that in the classroom this freedom applies to their areas of expertise, and not to introducing ideology or content unrelated to the subject matter of their classes.\n\nWe are also seeing more aggressive immigration policies and enforcement. International students at other universities have had their visas revoked and, in some instances, been detained. We are communicating directly with F-1 and J-1 visa holders about this situation and providing general advising on standard visa processes and information for international students and scholars about the resources available to them. We are also working directly with the representatives of a UW Medicine employee who was detained by immigration officials in late February when returning from a personal trip overseas. You can also review guidance on what to do if immigration officials come to a University facility.\n\nTo stay up to date on the latest developments in these areas, visit the Provost’s Office Federal Policy Updates site and the Office of State Relations News & Updates page.\n\nThese are difficult times for universities around the nation, and the UW is no exception. We will continue to work with our partners here in Washington and at the national level, guided by our mission and values.\n\nIn addition to the actions listed above, it is incumbent upon each of us to demonstrate the importance of the UW’s mission to the people of Washington and the United States. It is their investments that have created a system of universities that advance the nation’s health, prosperity and security and, as a result, is the envy of the world. And it is their investments — and our shared future — that are now at risk.",

    "content": "As we conclude Black History Month, it’s a great time to reflect on the incredible contributions that Black scholars, leaders, students and alumni have made within and beyond our University of Washington community. Their achievements and resilience offer a powerful lens through which we can understand and celebrate our shared history. The importance of expanding our knowledge and awareness of Black stories, achievements and legacies is not only about acknowledging one individual’s experience but in seeing a microcosm of the collective story of our nation. It’s an opportunity to recognize the ways in which Black history is our university’s, our community’s and our nation’s history.\n\nOur UW alumni include celebrated leaders and icons like Seattle’s first Black mayor, Norman Rice, our current mayor, Bruce Harrell and NBA great Isaiah Thomas. But there are many more Black alumni, as well as faculty and staff, whose stories and achievements are fascinating, if not as well known. They include Hamilton Greene, a law student who was also the UW’s first Black football player. He competed in the 1924 Rose Bowl at time when only a handful of Black athletes were welcomed on integrated teams.\n\nIn 1936, Maxine Haynes enrolled in the UW intending to study nursing. At that time, fewer than two dozen Black students attended the UW, and she faced significant hurdles, including a rejection from the nursing school because of her race. But elsewhere in the University, she found encouragement and support, earning her bachelor’s degree in sociology in 1941. Incredibly, she returned to the UW School of Nursing as a faculty member decades later.\n\nIn 1960, Seattle native Charles Mitchell was recruited to the UW as a running back for the Huskies, playing in two Rose Bowls. At that time, the UW had no formal organizations for Black students, so his home became a de facto gathering space. The community that formed around him helped him succeed academically, and he went on to become the president of Seattle Central Community College and eventually the chancellor of the Seattle Community Colleges District.\n\nFour years later, Robert Flennaugh became the first Black student to graduate from the UW School of Dentistry, a major achievement considering he himself had never even known a Black dentist. He went on to join the UW Dentistry faculty and later became the first Black member of the UW Board of Regents in the 1970s.\n\nAcross every discipline, the contributions of Black UW students and alumni are too numerous to list. In research, innovation, teaching and entrepreneurship, Black Huskies have been pivotal in expanding knowledge, improving their communities and serving the public. Their achievements are a reminder that diversity and access go hand in hand with progress and excellence in every facet of society, which is why Black History Month is as much about looking forward as reflecting on the past. It’s a time to consider how we can continue to build a world that values the contributions and voices of all people. At the University of Washington, we are committed to ensuring that our campuses are places where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and succeed and where the next generation of Black leaders will prepare for lives and careers of purpose and impact that will benefit us all.",

    "content": "As many in our community are aware, a recently proposed change to National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy would impose a cap of 15% on indirect costs for NIH-funded research. If implemented, this cap – along with other threats to federal funding and research support that have surfaced in recent weeks – would undermine the critical research infrastructure that has enabled the University of Washington and other research institutions to help the United States to maintain its global leadership in scientific innovation for decades.\n\nWe are closely monitoring changes in federal policies and taking actions to slow, mitigate or prevent any possible detrimental impacts they could have on our teaching, research, service and patient care in what is a highly fluid and unstable situation. Our efforts include partnering with the Washington Attorney General’s Office to support lawsuits filed to stop federal funding freezes and the NIH cap on indirect costs. We are pleased that the federal judges in both cases issued temporary restraining orders that bar the funding cuts, and we thank the AG’s office for its swift action. We continue to work closely with our state and federal partners to prevent any permanent reductions in upcoming budget actions and through changes in federal policy. We are also grateful for the support of our Congressional delegation, with whom we are in close contact on these issues.\n\nAs our research community knows, indirect costs, or Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs, are essential to conducting high-quality research that saves lives and supports the innovations of the future. These funds support critical infrastructure from laboratory space and equipment to research safety and laboratory support positions, and many other necessities vital to conducting cutting-edge research. Our research enterprise depends on federal F&A funds to maintain and expand life-saving medical research and clinical trials. Withdrawing support for these critical expenses would unquestionably stifle innovation and delay advances in areas like cancer, neuroscience, heart health, and infectious diseases, among many fields with the potential to transform health care and save countless lives. It would also have significant economic consequences, with thousands of laboratory, custodial, clinical and technical jobs in Washington and across the country at stake.\n\nThroughout this period of rapid-fire executive orders issued by the President, as well as unexpected and unprecedented directives by federal agencies, we have been and will continue working closely with our R-1 peers, state and federal partners to respond in the manner that best corresponds with our values and educational, research, health care and service missions. While our planning is continuous, any adjustments to our activities will be based on specific and verified information rather than speculation.\n\nAbove all, we are committed to supporting our community while navigating this uncertain terrain. We’ve established a central website with up-to-date information and institutional resources, including a site specifically focused on research. Our federal relations team is advocating on our behalf directly with our state delegation and in partnership with our higher education associations and Big Ten partners. We are in daily contact with the Washington Attorney General’s Office to ensure the important work we do in the service of access and excellence is protected to the full extent allowable by law.\n\nAmidst all the noise and chaos, the best thing we can do is continue our work on behalf of the public good – providing our students with transformative learning experiences, discovering innovations and advancements that improve the quality of life for so many in our community, and delivering the highest quality patient care. I am so grateful to be part of a community whose dedication to our mission and values have never been clearer or more important to uphold.",

    "content": "This message was sent to students, staff, and faculty and academic personnel across the University of Washington.\n\nDear UW community,\n\nEvery change of U.S. presidential administration brings with it changes in federal policy. But the whirlwind of executive orders and policy directives of this last week, combined with rumors of more to come, have created anger and fear for many in our community, while eliciting support from others. Whether in favor or against, or some of each, rapid change and uncertainty can be a source of anxiety and distress, especially when it is still unclear what some of these orders will actually entail and how they may affect our students, faculty or staff and our University community more broadly. Please know that we are closely evaluating and monitoring these policies and the possible impacts they could have on members of our community and on our public values of access and excellence in teaching, research, service and patient care and are in the process of evaluating how to deal with various scenarios.\n\nWe’ve provided a list of possible resources for information or support at the bottom of this message [see sidebar] that we will update as necessary. These include resources for undocumented students and for the many international students and scholars in our community since one of the largest concerns is around changes to federal immigration policies. We have been in close touch with undocumented students and international students and scholars since the fall and will continue to communicate with them directly as needed.\n\nOne area of special concern given our University and state’s ongoing commitment to the educational success of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients and undocumented students is how to respond in the event that federal officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or other representatives seek information about undocumented students and/or come to a UW campus or facility for an enforcement action.\n\nWashington state law prohibits the sharing of information or use of state resources, including University resources, to target Washington residents solely on the basis of race, religion, immigration, citizenship status, or national or ethnic origin. In addition, most student information is protected by federal law (FERPA). While immigration officials cannot enter a classroom, laboratory, campus residence or private office without an appropriate warrant or judicial order, we are not legally permitted to prevent federal immigration officials from coming into the public spaces of a UW campus or facility. And there might be instances when we will be required to respond to valid warrants or judicial orders.\n\nIf immigration officials come to your classroom, laboratory, campus residence or office, you must immediately contact the relevant safety office — their numbers are listed below. They’ll work with the Attorney General’s Office so that we can respond appropriately given relevant state and federal laws. Employees should also notify their supervisor. We would also appreciate it if you would contact your safety office if you become aware of immigration officials on a campus or at a UW facility more generally. Finally, Washington Governor Bob Ferguson today issued an executive order directing his administration to make preparations for supporting children whose caregivers are detained or deported, including working with the state’s colleges and universities to support students facing these situations. More directives or support from the state may be forthcoming.\n\nQuestions have also been raised about federal policy changes related to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. More specific guidance from the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Attorney General will be issued, but that guidance is not expected for several weeks. The same can be said of an executive order regarding a review of federal visa policies and of an executive order on gender identity, including that order’s impact on federal regulations governing sex- and gender-based discrimination, including Title IX.\n\nWe are committed to supporting our community while navigating this difficult terrain. While we await additional information from federal agencies, we remain in compliance with state and federal laws that guide our programs. We will continue activities as planned until or unless we are notified differently. We also remain in close contact with the Washington Attorney General’s office to ensure the important work we do in the service of access and excellence is protected to the full extent allowable by law.\n\nOther changes, while unquestionably disruptive, are expected to be temporary, such as the pause on communications from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through Feb. 1, including meetings to award federal health research grants. However, we remain highly concerned and are closely monitoring potential changes to how federal grants may be awarded, administered and/or discontinued. And, as you may know, there are still other executive orders and policies that are already being challenged in the courts or require congressional approval to implement.\n\nWe have and will continue to provide information to all academic and administrative leaders, and the entire UW community as necessary, when there is more definitive information to share, including from our state’s leaders.\n\nSince the UW opened its doors during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, our community has navigated through booms and busts, times of war and times of peace, two pandemics, technological revolutions, dramatic shifts in federal, state and local policies, and immense changes in our economy, population and society.\n\nThrough all these changes, we have remained committed to our mission of public service — to providing a world-class education and engaging in cutting-edge and life-changing scholarship, research and patient care, with a focus on enabling everyone in our community to thrive. Our commitment to our mission and our values remains steadfast and strong and will serve as our guide as we navigate these current changes.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAna Mari Cauce\n\nPresident\n\nProfessor of Psychology",

    "content": "Every day, our world grows more interconnected as technological, economic and cultural crosswinds create new interdependencies, touchpoints and exchanges. The University of Washington is preparing our students for the challenges and opportunities of working and living in a globally-connected economy, and we are deeply engaged in partnership, research, innovation and collaboration with academic colleagues and government and industry partners all over the world. Global engagement is not simply additive, it is a core part of our mission to foster innovation, address pressing global issues, and prepare the next generation for success, and why we are consistently ranked as one of the best global universities and a top producer of Fulbright Scholars.\n\nAcross our three campuses, global impact and engagement manifests in many ways. At UW Seattle, the Global Innovation Fund supports international, interdisciplinary research collaborations, and awarded more than $225,000 last year in seed funding for global research, learning, teaching and community building. At UW Tacoma, 2024 Global Initiatives Fellowships supported 11 UWT faculty and staff in developing new study abroad programming that engages historically marginalized students and/or underrepresented locations. At UW Bothell, the Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) initiative has connected almost 1,500 UW students with peers in different countries through more than 50 COIL courses, and COIL/ Study Abroad Launch Grants will soon support two faculty teams in developing new COIL and study abroad offerings. And in anticipation of the Men’s FIFA World Cup arriving in Seattle in 2026, the Jackson School of International Studies and UW partners have created the Global Sport Lab, an interdisciplinary pilot program to teach students and the public about global affairs and connections through athletics.\n\nOur campuses are teeming with opportunities for cross-cultural exchange for students. Through UW CIRCLE, we welcomed international students from more than 100 countries in the past year, and hosted over 100 events to foster cultural exchange with more scheduled for Winter quarter. For UW students, study abroad is more popular than ever: more than 2,800 students studied abroad in 2023-2024, with Huskies traveling to more than 70 countries and participating in more than 500 international study and internship opportunities. And our alumni continue to be involved in our thriving network of international Huskies that boasts more than 17 chapters and communities around the world.\n\nLeading our global engagement strategy is the Office of Global Affairs, and next month, we are very excited to welcome our new Vice Provost for Global Affairs, Dr. Ahmad Ezzaddine. Ahmad will lead OGA’s work to enhance and expand the UW’s global partnerships, as well as collaborating with University partners to build a cohesive and campus-wide vision for global engagement.\n\nFor our students who will be competing for jobs in a global marketplace, and for the public who benefit from research that transcends borders, global engagement is critical for workforce preparedness and advancing new technologies, medicine and innovation. At the University of Washington, we are committed to making these connections a fundamental part of how we learn, discover, and lead.",

    "content": "On Monday, our University will honor the abiding legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with a day of reflection and service. By coincidence, that day will also mark the inauguration of the next president of the United States. Despite the undeniable fact that the election was contentious and that our society remains very polarized, the work of a university like ours, dedicated to the mission of education, research, and serving the public through critical thinking, evidence-based dialogue and the free exchange of ideas, is especially critical during these times. Indeed, while times of uncertainty and rapid change can create anxiety, they also create the potential for change, and we must continue to seek progress together with action and intention, in the model that Dr. King exemplified throughout his life of service and advocacy.\n\nAs the civil rights leader John Lewis, whose own life was so inspired by the work of Dr. King, noted “Democracy is not a state, it is an act.” And in Dr. King’s own words “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” Our democracy depends on a citizenry of informed, engaged individuals who are invested in building and maintaining strong institutions, including vibrant public education, a free and uncensored press, free and fair elections, checks and balances on those in power, and a judicial system that provides equitable and humane treatment to all who come before it. Our University can best create and support these conditions when all members of our community feel included and empowered to make a contribution, regardless of their social, political, or religious views, shared ancestry, where they are from, who they love, or any other aspect of their identity. These principles at the heart of our community are enduring.\n\nAcross the UW, we extend Dr. King’s legacy in countless ways. Our Center for an Informed Public works to strengthen democratic discourse, and our Evans School of Public Policy & Governance is collaborating with UW’s Community Engagement and Leadership Education (CELE) Center on the NextGen Civic Leader Corps to help students connect to civic engagement and public service. In our law school, the Gates Public Service Law program provides tuition to law students who commit to working in public service.\n\nThroughout his life, Dr. King led by example because he saw clearly that true impact requires work and action. Our UW community is steeped in the importance of creating impact through public service and sustained effort to build a more equitable, inclusive future for all. I hope you will take some time to reflect on your part in this shared project, and I look forward to our continued efforts together to uphold our democratic values and the ongoing journey toward Dr. King’s dream.",

    "content": "Earlier this month, we presented a livestreamed town hall to discuss the University’s budget and our approach to addressing the crisis we are facing. If you weren’t able to watch in person, a recording has been posted uw.edu/president/uw-budget-town-hall/. Your engagement in these discussions is crucial to our future.\n\nThe University of Washington is facing a budget crisis due to the convergence of reductions to our state funding and federal changes, including proposed cuts to research funding. Together, these pressures create an urgent need to reduce our operating budgets and ensure that our expenses do not continue to exceed our revenues.\n\nImpact of state budget cuts\n\nDue to Washington’s budget crisis, all state universities, including the UW, will receive less state funding and be expected to increase their share of expenses. First, the state will implement a 1.5% reduction in core funding for higher education. Second, the legislature is also reducing the state’s share of the UW’s “fund split” for employee compensation, requiring us to cover 81 cents of every new dollar spent on compensation. Third, the state is increasing the costs the UW must pay for employee benefits. In total, these actions result in an effective 6.5% cut to our state operating budget.\n\nAlthough Gov. Bob Ferguson has not signed the budget yet, we do not expect significant changes and are planning to implement the legislature’s final budget.\n\nUnstable and chaotic federal policy and funding landscape\n\nFrequent changes to grant management, such as allowable costs, award terminations, reimbursement protocol modifications, and attestation requirements, have unilaterally impacted approved research grants and contracts to the UW and the infrastructure that supports them. Our University, like all universities across the country, faces ever-evolving regulations and the risk of significant losses in indirect cost reimbursements for federally funded work. These challenges and delays in payment for work already completed have impacted our faculty, staff, and students, even before the U.S. Congress determines overall federal agency spending later this fall.\n\nUW budget reductions and layoffs\n\nAs the state and federal landscape evolved over this academic year, UW schools, colleges, and campuses were progressively tasked with reducing current spending and planning for potential future cuts, all with the goal of mitigating impacts. This work was important preparation to meet the cuts the University now faces. Friday, May 9, UW schools, colleges, administrative support units, and campuses were directed to reduce their core budgets by an average of 4.7% starting in FY26, which begins July 1. This still allows for a modest compensation plan necessary to address the cost-of-living pressures in our region.\n\nIt is almost impossible to imagine a scenario in which layoffs will not be necessary. These difficult decisions will be made with the least harm to the fewest employees. Budget planning is being done at the unit level, and in the case of colleges and schools, in collaboration with elected faculty councils. As a result, budget impacts, including layoffs, will vary by the unit. Each unit, as well as executive leadership, will continue to update with details as plans are finalized.\n\nLimits on endowment and reserves\n\nBecause our endowment is more than 99% restricted, those funds cannot be allocated to purposes not specified by the donors. Nonetheless, these resources will continue to provide important support for activities that are essential for our mission, including scholarships, fellowships, professorships, programs, and other beneficiaries of those endowments.\n\nThe University does maintain reserves to protect our mission. Our approach has been more measured relative to our peers, however, because our funds are more limited in comparison. If these reserves are depleted much beyond current levels, the University will incur higher borrowing costs which could result in deeper cuts in the future. As stewards of public resources, it is unsustainable to continue using one-time funds to address ongoing imbalances in our expenses and revenues.\n\nLooking forward\n\nIn order to meet the urgent needs of this very difficult moment, we will need to reimagine our approach to teaching, research, scholarship, patient care and community engagement to protect the foundation of our mission. To competitively position ourselves for the future, we must intentionally decide where to invest our resources, expertise and talent so we can make the greatest difference.\n\nWe thank you for the excellent and important work that you are contributing to this university-wide effort. We will continue to provide updates, as will unit leaders, as the situation changes. And while the landscape continues to shift – and the plans and decisions we are making in response are extraordinarily difficult – our future will be stronger by working together to find the best path forward.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPresident Ana Mari Cauce\n\nProvost Tricia R. Serio\n\nChief Financial Officer Sarah Norris Hall",

    "content": "This message was sent to faculty and academic personnel across the University of Washington\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nOn Friday, May 2, the National Science Foundation released a new policy that, as of Monday, May 5, applies a standard indirect cost rate not to exceed 15% to all grants and cooperative agreements awarded to higher education institutions, including the University of Washington.\n\nFunding opportunities issued after May 5 will include notices of this cap on the reimbursement for indirect research costs. This policy does not apply retroactively to existing awards, so there is no change in rates for remaining funding on an existing grant, continuing grant increments and supplements to those awards when effectuated by amendments.\n\nWe are seeking legal guidance as to whether the negotiated rates should apply to new proposals or awards that are based on a funding opportunity that did not have this restriction. And a lawsuit challenging this policy has already been filed by the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education.\n\nDue to the uncertainty posed by this policy and the fact that the 15% rate does not provide sufficient funds for UW to meet its obligations to support the research proposed, the UW Office of Sponsored Programs will pause processing of NSF awards with notification dates on or after May 5. OSP will delay submission of new proposals where there is no immediate deadline. These pauses will remain in effect until we have clarity on the legality of this unilateral change to our negotiated indirect cost rates.\n\nNSF awards with notice dates before May 5 that have not yet been set up will be set up with the federally negotiated rate. All NSF proposals pending submission in OSP were submitted by May 3 with the negotiated rates.\n\nAs we have said in other communications, the negotiated indirect cost rate reflects the true cost of conducting research as determined through federal government auditing. And in many ways, it is actually less than the true cost, because administrative expenses – including to oversee compliance with various federal regulations – are capped. I know that these pauses are not ideal and will have real impacts on research and researchers; however, the UW simply cannot meet its obligations to support federally funded research projects if the NSF rate is capped at this level, which is also the case for attempts by the National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy to impose similar caps.\n\nI or the Office of Research will communicate updates about this situation, including the pause on award processing, as we have more information.\n\nWe are part of a national group working on a simpler format for reimbursement of indirect costs of research, which we hope will provide a fair and effective method that the administration and Congress will support. In the meantime, we will continue to coordinate with our national partners and the Washington Attorney General’s Office to come to a resolution that enables universities to continue to conduct the research that has made America healthier, safer and more prosperous over these past many decades.",

    "content": "I still remember the key event that sparked what would become a passion for understanding prions. It involved a bet for a slice of pie, which I lost to a postdoc in the lab where I was conducting undergraduate research on lipid metabolism.\n\nTo say he was eccentric would be an understatement, and when he asked me one day if I had heard about infectious proteins, I was skeptical (and am now dating myself). He was adamant that he could prove it to me, hence the bet, and after a trip to the library to photocopy a few research articles (another anecdote that dates me), he convinced me. And I have been hooked ever since.\n\nI was reminded of this story when I read interviews with 12 UW researchers who described how they fell in love with their research. For Katya Cherukumilli, outdoor experiences as child inspired her to research access to drinking water. Frequent power outages and surges prompted June Lukuyu to develop sustainable energy solutions for underserved communities. And Bára Šafářová became an expert on Chagas disease, thanks to a bug who bit her in the middle of the night. You can read their stories, and others, published by UW News.\n\nAcross our campuses, more than 62,000 students are falling in love with science, the humanities, the arts, medicine. They are discovering passions and interests that may last a month, or a lifetime. In addition to sunny weather, cherry blossoms and the excitement of commencement ceremonies, spring quarter brings us many opportunities that are open to the public to see what our students are doing and the impact they are having on advancing knowledge and understanding for the benefit of all.\n\nUndergraduate engagement and research are the focus of two celebrations on the Seattle campus. The Spring CELEbration, 4:30-7:30 p.m., Wednesday, May 7 in the HUB, will feature student presentations on their community-based service, leadership and advocacy as part of the Community Engagement and Leadership Education (CELE) Center and Mary Gates Scholars program – housed within Undergraduate Academic Affairs (UAA).\n\nOn May 16, more than 1,200 undergraduates from 100 disciplines across our three campuses and other institutions will set up their posters, give 10-minute oral presentations, hang their visual art and designs, and take the stage at the Undergraduate Research Symposium, also sponsored by UAA. I am looking forward to attending the opening of this daylong symposium, which has taken place for nearly 30 years.\n\nAnother is the Graduate School’s Three-Minute Thesis , which challenges graduate students to explain their research – in everyday language – in just three minutes with one slide. This competition, May 22 in Alder Hall, celebrates the exciting capstone and research experiences of master’s and doctoral students at the University of Washington from all three campuses. I am excited to serve as a judge at this year’s competition.\n\niSchool students will give in person and virtual presentations on their milestone projects, such as capstones, volunteer work, portfolios, research and study abroad, at the iSchool Showcase, 5:30-9 p.m., Wednesday, June 4, in the HUB.\n\nArt and design students graduating this year will showcase their best works in the 2025 Graduation Exhibitions. This series of shows takes place through June 15 at the Jacob Lawrence Gallery and the Henry Art Gallery to celebrate students in the School of Art + Art History + Design’s bachelors, master’s of fine arts and master of design programs.\n\nEach quarter at UW Tacoma, undergraduates majoring in environmental sciences, biomedical sciences, environmental sustainability, and mathematics present their research, internships, community service and innovations. Spring quarter’s Sciences and Mathematics Undergraduate Research Symposium (SAMURS), will be at 10 a.m.-2 p.m., Thursday, June 12, in Milgard Hall.\n\nThrough film screenings, student-led talks, exhibitions, presentations and poster sessions, UW Bothell students from across disciplines will present their research and learning at the campus-wide Student Academic Showcase May 13-15.\n\nAnd if you did not have an opportunity to join President Cauce and me, along with other UW leaders, faculty and staff, to celebrate the 10th cohort of the Husky 100, please read the amazing stories of how these undergraduate and graduate students are making the most of their time at the UW.\n\nThese showcases are tangible examples of why we are here — to teach, mentor and guide our students so they can keep innovation, research and creativity moving forward for not only their generation but also for those to come. Almost nothing is more rewarding than seeing this passion come alive in our students, watching them ask questions, and pursue answers, solutions, and new expressions.\n\nAt a time when the value of this work is questioned and the weight of that lost trust is felt every day, we must not be distracted from these opportunities to engage with our students and to celebrate their accomplishments. As was the case for each one of us, these experiences mark the beginning of a lifetime of contributions built from an initial interest, nurtured by opportunities to explore it in depth, and serving as the foundation for endless paths to realize its impact in the world. This continuum forms the core of our mission, and together we have always and will continue to ensure its resilience.\n\nI look forward to sharing in the joy of these events with you.",

    "content": "Across the University, we work collectively to provide a welcoming, supportive environment that encourages curiosity, creativity, discovery, and innovation. It is within this environment that students find their passions and chart their futures, faculty advance knowledge and make discoveries, and staff support and strengthen all aspects of the University. The different perspectives and experience each of us contributes enrich and inform the environment — and the impact that comes from it.\n\nAs I noted in my town hall presentation last month, we must encourage, maintain and protect our connections to each other in this moment and for the future. And in unpredictable times, we must use our differences as our guide to expand the relevance of our mission to all.\n\nBecause we are committed to fostering a culture where each person feels confident in expressing their opinions and concerns — and because faculty play a vital role in that outcome — the Office of the Provost is piloting two programs that we plan to continue in years to come. One is training to assist faculty in navigating and resolving conflicts in academic settings, and the second is the Provost’s Academy to cultivate the next generation of UW academic leaders and bring additional perspectives to University-wide work.\n\nConflict Engagement and Resolution Training\n\nDeans, associate deans, chairs, and faculty from all three campuses are learning how to navigate conflict effectively in academic settings through the Conflict Engagement and Resolution Training Program. This program is sponsored by the Office of the Provost and Academic Personnel and Faculty, in partnership with Professor Christine Cimini and Emeritus Associate Professor Alan Kirtley from the School of Law’s Mediation Clinic.\n\nThese in-person, hands-on training sessions cover the basics of conflict theory, as participants learn to:\n\nengage in difficult conversations in a respectful and productive manner,\n\nde-escalate situations that may become hostile or inflamed,\n\nand approach conflict constructively to reach resolutions that benefit all parties.\n\nSeventy-two participants will engage in the training in three cohorts, meeting in March, May, or June.\n\nProvost’s Academy\n\nBecause our University’s greatest strength is the people who create our unique take on the academic mission, elevating diverse perspectives from different vantage points is key to our continued excellence.\n\nTo provide a pathway for integrating those perspectives into institution-wide projects, the Provost’s Academy is designed to recognize and engage emerging faculty leaders throughout the University. The Provost’s Academy provides a dynamic experience that blends experiential learning, collaborative projects, networking and mentorship to foster both personal and professional growth for participants and to advance our academic mission.\n\nThe participants are engaging in strategic thinking and planning alongside senior UW leaders as they develop a deeper understanding of the issues that affect the administration of UW programs and initiatives and their interconnectivity.\n\nThe six faculty, listed below, in this inaugural cohort are gaining insights, through direct participation in a project, into one of the major functional areas of the Office of the Provost, each led by a vice provost.\n\nCecilia Aragon, professor, Human Centered Design & Engineering\n\nFrançois Baneyx, vice provost for innovation and director of CoMotion\n\nUW faculty consistently develop ideas, algorithms, designs, and methods with significant potential, yet many faculty remain hesitant to pursue commercialization due to unfamiliarity with entrepreneurial processes and terminology. Cecilia Aragon is identifying barriers, friction points and challenges from the perspectives of CoMotion staff and faculty participants. Then, she will develop either a low-stakes, time-efficient entrepreneurial environment or enhancements to CoMotion’s existing programs to reduce barriers to faculty engagement and accelerate the translation of academic innovation into market-ready solutions.\n\nTed Poor, associate professor, Music\n\nEd Taylor, vice provost and dean or undergraduate academic affairs\n\nAt the core of great music lies many principles, skills and perspectives that transcend the field of music to other areas of study – intensive listening, improvisation, and sustained focus, to name a few. Ted Poor is gathering ideas from faculty and undergraduates on creativity, improvisation, and how individuals can leverage their perspectives to work towards excellence and discovery. This work has the potential to spark new collaborations in faculty research and interdisciplinary, project based, research-forward courses.\n\nEmma Spiro, associate professor in the iSchool and a co-founder and faculty director of the UW Center for an Informed Public\n\nFred Nafukho, vice provost for academic personnel and faculty\n\nMari Ostendorf, vice provost for research\n\nBuilding on her center’s collaborations with units across campus, Emma Spiro is designing UW policy for developing proactive measures and responses to incidents of researcher intimidation and harassment. In addition, she is gaining a deeper understanding of the Office of the Provost’s responsibilities, especially those related to academic personnel and faculty.\n\nCasey Self, teaching professor, Biology\n\nBecca Price, professor, Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences at UW Bothell\n\nPhil Reid, vice provost of academic strategy and affairs\n\nCourse and program learning outcomes are essential in defining our general education curriculum. They are a critical component of instructional quality and are requisite to meet certain accreditation standards. In light of this, a task force, co-chaired by Becca Price, is identifying a process to define and curate undergraduate learning outcomes. At the same time, Casey Self, who is a member of the task force, is focusing on ensuring that learning outcomes are aligned with the core elements of effective teaching, as defined by Faculty Senate’s recently approved Class A legislation. Subsequent work will involve implementation of the task force recommendations.\n\nHeather Hill, professor, Evans School\n\nMari Ostendorf, vice provost for research\n\nHeather Hill is helping the Office of Research expand and rethink efforts to communicate the breadth of UW research impact to the public, including telling stories of the people who benefit from UW research and fostering conversations that help researchers see new opportunities for their work to benefit the people of our state.\n\nAlready, Mari Ostendorf has found value in working with the Provost’s Academy participants. “They bring perspectives of different research disciplines that contribute to my decision making and problem solving. It’s also an opportunity for the fellows to learn about the variety and complexity of challenges facing leadership, particularly right now.”\n\nOpen to full-time faculty members on all tracks and all three campuses who have been appointed at the UW for at least three years and are beyond the first promotion review, the program received more than three dozen applications for the six spots in inaugural cohort.\n\nUW faculty are renowned for their innovative thinking and collaborative approach. These programs highlight faculty enthusiasm for expanding the reach of these assets to advance all aspects of our University. Especially during these times, I know that it will be the engagement of our faculty that will pave the way to our continued success.",

    "content": "Wilmore Webley, senior vice provost for equity and inclusion, has announced the selection of 12 faculty members for the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity (NCFDD) Summer 2025 Faculty Success Program (FSP). The 10-week online program, which begins in May, aims to support non-tenure track, tenure track and tenured faculty in enhancing their research and writing productivity through empirically tested methods, while also improving work-life balance and fostering personal growth.\n\nThe selected Faculty Success Fellows were recommended by their respective departments and colleges, following a comprehensive assessment of their needs and the potential impact on their career paths, especially in relation to tenure, promotion or continuation of contracts for lecturers.\n\nTo support their participation, the fellows will receive funding through a cost-sharing model involving their department, college and the Office of the Provost, to help cover the costs associated with the NCFDD Faculty Success Program.

    "content": "Chancellor Javier Reyes has announced an initial three-year university commitment of $600,000 to fund the newly formed Intergroup Dialogue Initiative (IGDI). A collaboration between the Office of the Chancellor, Office of the Provost, and Student Affairs and Campus Life (SACL), the IGDI seeks to foster dialogue on the university’s campus about important, relevant and controversial issues, encourage difficult conversations across diverse perspectives and establish more meaningful connections in informed and productive ways.\n\nHoused within the Office of the Provost, the IGDI aims to enhance the ability of faculty, students and staff to lead intergroup discussions and establish UMass Amherst as a prominent figure in intergroup dialogue (IGD) practice and research, both nationally and globally.\n\nXimena Zúñiga, professor of social justice education in the College of Education and a leading expert in IGD, and Dave Neely, SACL’s director of diversity, education and training, will serve as co-directors of the initiative. The overarching goal of IGD is to foster understanding and bridging of different, and sometimes conflicting, perspectives and cultural and social identities with status differences through dialogic engagement and community building. It aims to skillfully and consciously support the co-creation of practices and visions not readily apparent in contexts that are polarizing, fractured or merely tolerant.\n\n“This initiative will equip our students, faculty and staff to effectively respond to the growing national polarization regarding domestic and international geopolitical issues, as well as free speech concerns, and their impact on campus life,” Reyes says. “I am thankful to Wilmore Webley, senior vice provost of equity and inclusion; Shelly Perdomo Amed, vice chancellor for student affairs and campus life; Deborah Gould, vice provost for administration and finance; and Fouad Abd-El-Khalick, provost and senior vice chancellor for academic affairs, for their support and guidance in working with Professor Zúñiga and Dr. Neely to develop the structure and budget for the IGDI.”\n\n“By providing the tools necessary to foster the types of dialogues that we need and are looking to have in these times, the IGDI will serve as a cornerstone to the university’s mission of creating a community of dignity and respect,” Abd-El-Khalick says.\n\n“Intergroup dialogue is a humanizing, equity-driven and evidence-based practice that fosters agency and has the potential to bridge differences,” explains Zúñiga, who recently completed a one-year Chancellor Leadership Fellowship with Webley, during which she developed an IGD toolkit and hosted communities of practice. “Dialogic practices, such as IGD, are of vital importance at a time when campuses are still reeling from the socio-emotional effects of increasing political polarization, an epidemic of social isolation and increasingly contentious debates about free speech and civil discourse.”\n\nAs immediate next steps, Zúñiga and Neely will recruit a steering committee to provide guidance and assist in the initiative’s launch. They will also recruit and train faculty and staff to serve as IGD Facilitation Fellows who will lead short or sustained dialogue efforts and support their development through engaged communities of practice.\n\nOver the past two decades more than 100 colleges and universities nationwide have adopted some form of IGD program, Webley notes. UMass Amherst has played a unique leadership role in the Northeast region over the past 25 years, serving as a research and graduate student training hub for IGD practitioners at the masters, doctoral and graduate certificate levels, as well as for faculty, staff and student affairs educators at UMass Amherst, the Five Colleges and across the region. The IGDI builds upon this longstanding collaboration between the College of Education’s Social Justice Education Concentration and SACL, and will bring the principles of IGD into classrooms, offices and other spaces across campus where people interact.\n\nAfter three years, the initiative will be reviewed and assessed for renewal.\n\nMore information about the IGDI, including details about the initiative’s launch and the call for IGD Facilitation Fellows, will be announced on the Provost’s Office website in the coming weeks.",

    "content": "Dear UMass community,\n\n\n\nI am delighted to announce Keith Marzullo has been selected as the next dean of the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS), effective July 1, 2025. He is a renowned computer scientist, educator and policy leader with a passion for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. I look forward to his contributions to the university’s strategic initiatives and his innovative approach to student engagement and success.\n\nKeith’s extensive knowledge and experience will be invaluable as he continues building on the university’s 60 years of academic excellence in computer science and informatics. That legacy includes the awarding of the 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award to professor emeritus Andrew Barto for his work developing the conceptual and algorithmic foundations of a branch of artificial intelligence known as reinforcement learning (RL). Our deep bench of CICS faculty includes 20 ACM Fellows, 11 IEEE Fellows, and 36 NSF CAREER Award winners.\n\nIt is also an inspiring time, as CICS celebrates the 10th anniversary of when the school was elevated to a college in 2015, and prepares for the opening of its new building to serve its 2,000 undergraduate, 400 master’s and 300 doctoral students as a hub for community, collaboration and innovative research. Keith will spearhead the creation of an integrated academic and research space that accommodates our rapid growth, serves as a destination for our community and enables the next big ideas in computing and technology.\n\n\n\nKeith comes to UMass Amherst from the University of Maryland (UMD), where he has served as dean of the College of Information since 2016. During his tenure, the college grew from 500 students to over 2,600, with the faculty doubling in size. The first undergraduate major in the college, the B.S. in information science, launched in 2016 and is now the second largest and one of the most diverse STEM majors on the UMD campus. His work also contributed to the significant expansion of public-private partnerships at the university.\n\nPrior to his time at UMD, Keith served as director of the National Coordination Program for Networking and Information Technology in the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House. He also spent five years at the National Science Foundation, where he directed the Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate. He served as chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego for five years, as a faculty member at Cornell University and taught at the University of Tromsø in Norway.\n\n\n\nKeith received his bachelor’s degree in physics from Occidental College in Los Angeles and earned both an M.S. in applied physics and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford.\n\n\n\nI would like to thank the faculty, staff and students, as well as academic leaders from across campus, who participated in the search process. I am likewise grateful to all members of the Dean of CICS Search Advisory Committee for their commitment and dedication to this search. I applaud the hard work and thoughtful leadership of committee co-chairs Sanjay Raman, dean of the College of Engineering, and Laura Vandenberg, associate vice chancellor and vice provost for research and engagement.\n\n\n\nI want to express my gratitude to Laura Haas for her service as the dean of CICS for the past eight years and the strong foundation she built for the college. Her incredibly successful tenure as the first permanent dean of CICS has resulted in a 60% increase in undergraduate and graduate enrollment. She has brought in millions of dollars of funding for scholarships to increase the enrollment of women and underrepresented students in computing and has overseen the development of programming and curriculum to promote inclusivity and a sense of belonging.\n\nI deeply appreciate Laura’s dedication and am grateful that she will continue to be part of the college as a faculty member following a one-year sabbatical.\n\n\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Keith to the UMass Amherst community.\n\nAll my best,\n\nFouad Abd-El-Khalick\n\nProvost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nI am writing with important advice about international travel for faculty and researchers in service of our commitment to support the safety and wellbeing of all members of our community. While uncertainty persists around federal actions related to immigration and enforcement, I ask that you evaluate carefully the need for any planned, non-critical travel outside the United States based on an understanding of your risk profile and tolerance. Travelers must be in compliance with university policies and consider the following advice carefully before engaging in university-related or personal international travel:\n\nTravel Advice\n\nIn general, all people arriving to the U.S. have basic rights at the ports of entry. However, all international travelers, including U.S. citizens, have diminished First and Fourth Amendment rights before admission into the U.S. All international travelers are subject to inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) when arriving at both air and land ports of entry. CBP will screen travelers to determine whether they are “admissible.”\n\nCBP agents may ask travelers questions, including those related to the purpose of their travel and eligibility to enter the United States. CBP may collect biographic and biometric data, run records checks, and conduct warrantless searches of bags and electronic devices and otherwise attempt to determine whether someone should be admitted to the United States.\n\nIn searching electronic devices, they may ask for access to social media accounts, including usernames and passwords, and can scrutinize and copy sensitive digital information. These searches do not generally violate the Fourth Amendment’s proscription against unreasonable search and seizure. If a traveler refuses to cooperate, CBP may delay their travel, seize their device, and further detain and question them. For non-U.S. citizens, CBP may also deny entry.\n\nAll non-U.S. citizens should carry with them documentation that corroborates their identity and immigration status at all times during travel and while present in the U.S. Legal permanent residents should carry with them their Green Card. Non-immigrants or people on temporary statuses should carry with them a photo ID, such as a valid passport or state issued ID, and immigration documents specific to their status.\n\nIf you are a faculty member on UMass visa sponsorship, please make sure to consult with your immigration advisor at the Office of Global Affairs. You will also be receiving additional information directly from that office.\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nAs a reminder, all university-related international travel by faculty, students, and staff is required to be pre-approved and registered as per the university’s Travel Policy and the university's Business and Travel Expense Policy.\n\nPer Board of Trustees Policy, this includes all international travel where the traveler brings university-owned devices or accesses university data. Further, all international travelers should consult with the Office of Global Affairs (@email) and the Office of Research Compliance (@email) on any additional permissions or protocols required when traveling to high-risk destinations or when traveling with or accessing university-owned electronic devices or data, as well as when travelling with research equipment or research materials.\n\nThe protocols on using university-owned devices or accessing university data while on personal travel are similar to university-related travel. Travelers should likewise consult on their personal travel with the above-mentioned offices as applicable.\n\nThe advice above is offered out of an abundance of caution and my purpose is to enable all travelers to make an informed assessment of the heightened risks of international travel while uncertainty persists around federal immigration enforcement. The university is committed to ensuring the safety of all members of our community and we will continue to share information and resources in a timely fashion based on our monitoring of the landscape.\n\n\n\nFouad Abd-El-Khalick\n\nProvost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs",

    "content": "This message was shared with all faculty and staff on May 7th, 2025.\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\n\n\nYesterday marked a significant milestone in Drexel’s future, as Faculty Senate representatives held the final vote to support integrating schools and colleges as part of the Academic Transformation. Specifically, the Senate voted on integrating the School of Education within the College of Arts and Sciences, and unifying the College of Engineering, the College of Computing & Informatics, and the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems into a single college with three schools. These endorsements reflect the open dialogue and shared leadership of our deans, faculty, and professional staff — and our collective commitment to strengthening Drexel.\n\n\n\nThese changes build upon the substantial progress already made in reimagining Drexel's academic structure, including the integrations of the First-Year Exploratory Studies program into the College of Arts and Sciences; the Charles D. Close School of Entrepreneurship within the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business; and the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute within the Dornsife School of Public Health.\n\n\n\nAcademic Transformation is a bold, strategic effort to reimagine how we structure and deliver education. By reducing internal competition and fostering collaboration, we are creating the space and conditions for innovation — enhancing the student experience, simplifying pathways, and expanding interdisciplinary teaching and learning. At the same time, this work must sharpen Drexel’s identity, attract prospective students, and fuel growth through distinctive, cross-cutting programs.\n\n\n\nThis progress is only possible through the extraordinary engagement and leadership of our faculty and professional staff. We especially want to thank Co-Sponsor on Academic Transformation, Senate Chair Kevin Owens, for his leadership and partnership.\n\n\n\nIn the months ahead, we will continue working across colleges and schools to build shared priorities, support a smooth path forward, and sustain momentum as we begin to realize the full potential of these changes for our community.\n\n\n\nThank you for your continued engagement and collaboration as we shape the future of Drexel together.\n\nDenis P. O’Brien\n\nInterim President\n\nPaul E. Jensen, PhD\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\nNina Henderson Provost\n\nAcademic Transformation Co-Sponsor",

    "content": "Summary\n\nWorking Groups complete Sprint #1; completed reports can be found on the Academic Transformation SharePoint.\n\nA review process has been established for working group deliverables to engage and receive input from a range of stakeholders.\n\nGuidance has been added for talking to prospective students about Academic Transformation.\n\nFaculty Senate approves integration of Close School of Entrepreneurship within LeBow College of Business.\n\nThis message was shared with all faculty and staff on February 26th, 2025.\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to share exciting updates on Academic Transformation.\n\nSprint Reports\n\nThe five Academic Transformation working groups – Academic Integration, Calendar, Consistency, Core Competencies and Curricular Structure – are each working in sprints to address specific objectives and deliverables that build toward the charge of their respective groups.\n\n\n\nAll five groups have completed their first sprint, and three of the five have completed their accompanying reports and initial steps of review. We encourage you to read through these first reports from the Calendar, Core Competencies and Curricular Structure teams on the Academic Transformation SharePoint.\n\n\n\nThe remaining team reports will be added when finalized and reviewed.\n\nReview Process\n\nAfter completing their sprints, the working groups submit reports for review by multiple project leaders and stakeholders, including student government representatives, as well as Academic Council, which is comprised of all deans, the Faculty Senate Steering Committee, and Provost’s Office leadership. Conversations around the first three reports have been both positive and productive, marked by thoughtful and collaborative engagement that has expanded on the opportunities presented.\n\n\n\nWorking group deliverables that require Senate review will move on to the Faculty Senate following these stakeholder meetings. The first three sprint reports will be reviewed at the Senate meeting on March 18, with the working group co-chairs in attendance to present the outcomes. We encourage all to attend and ask questions.\n\n\n\nFor reference, a diagram of the full sprint review process can be viewed on the SharePoint here.\n\nEnrollment Management Talking Points and FAQs\n\nIn addition to streamlining the AT SharePoint site overall, two updates have been added under Resources and FAQ:\n\nTalking Points have been added to provide guidance in key areas. The section contains recruitment-related points from Enrollment Management and University Marketing & Communications to guide faculty and staff in discussing Academic Transformation with prospective students and families. Additional talking points will be added for other stakeholders, as they are developed by units across the University.\n\nFAQs on Enrollment Management/Impact have been added. These points were distilled from the Enrollment Management presentation at their Jan. 30 Summit.\n\nIf you have additional requests for Talking Points or FAQs, please submit them via the Qualtrics form or by emailing pmoe@drexel.edu.\n\nAcademic Integration Proposal\n\nAt its February 18 meeting, Faculty Senate voted to approve the proposal to integrate the Charles D. Close School of Entrepreneurship within the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, this proposal was drafted and endorsed by LeBow Dean Vibhas Madan, PhD, and Close Dean Donna M. De Carolis, PhD, and received support from their respective faculty and academic leadership. Related documents and Senate meeting recordings can be found under “Past Meetings” on the Senate website.\n\n\n\nWe are grateful to the faculty and professional staff on these teams for their thoughtful and comprehensive contributions in this first sprint, and to all who have engaged in providing insight, feedback or support in this process in countless ways. The conversations prompted by the teams’ work have been exciting, and we look forward to further discussion and details in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nVice Provost for Academic Strategy & Communications\n\nAcademic Transformation Project Lead\n\n\n\nKevin Owens, PhD\n\nChair, Faculty Senate\n\nAssociate Professor of Chemistry\n\nAcademic Transformation Co-Sponsor\n\n\n\nPaul E.

    "content": "This message was shared with all faculty and staff on February 12th, 2025.\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\n\n\nI’m pleased to share that effective Feb. 1, 2025, Aroutis Foster, PhD, Interim Dean and Professor of Learning Technologies in the School of Education, was appointed to the additional role of Project Director for the Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Philadelphia AMP). This position was previously held by Steve Cox, who retired Jan. 31, 2025, but has graciously agreed to serve in a part-time, temporary capacity to ensure the program’s seamless leadership transition.\n\n\n\nSteve’s dedication and tireless effort were instrumental in establishing Philadelphia AMP and spearheading it into the robust program it is today. After receiving his BS in physics and atmospheric science in 1974 and his MS in biophysics and biomedical engineering - both from Drexel - in 1976, Steve embarked on a career at General Electric as a physicist in reentry ballistics and later at Boeing where he worked in flight dynamics. During his academic and professional experiences, he was struck by the scarcity of minority representation in engineering and scientific fields.\n\n\n\nBeginning in the early 1990s, Steve began taking steps to reverse this trend. At the same time, the National Science Foundation (NSF) sought to establish multi-year, multi-million-dollar grants to support institutions and programming proven to increase the number of underrepresented students in STEM-related fields of study and, ultimately, careers.\n\n\n\nBacked by NSF funding, Steve helped launch in 1994 Philadelphia AMP, which is part of the national, NSF-founded Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program. Philadelphia AMP united nine local higher-education institutions to collaborate and share resources toward a common goal to increase the number of students whose identities are underrepresented in STEM disciplines.\n\n\n\nIt is through this work that Steve leaves a tremendous legacy. Since its inception, Philadelphia AMP has produced more than 20,000 BS degree recipients, 6,000 MS degrees and over 800 PhDs as of 2023, the latest year in which data were available. This is compared to 200 graduating with STEM degrees before the alliance was established.\n\n\n\nSteve is also a recipient of numerous awards and honors that recognized his many accomplishments at Drexel including an honorary doctorate in Science and Engineering Education, Provost Award for Outstanding Scholarly Productivity, and the creation of the Outstanding Undergraduate Student Award established by the Office of Student Affairs in his name.\n\n\n\n\"Steve was a visionary in recognizing that STEM fields were failing to recruit, develop, and retain top talent from the fastest growing demographics in the country,\" said Leslie Ashburn-Nardo, vice provost of faculty advancement and inclusion, who worked directly with Steve. \"Many programs have the goal of ‘filling the pipeline’ with students whose identities have historically been underrepresented in STEM. Steve actually was that pipeline, always availing himself not only to current students in LSAMP, but also to alumni who continue to seek his wise counsel years after graduation. He is a beloved mentor to many.”\n\n\n\nI am grateful Aroutis, who has previously served as co-principal investigator of Philadelphia AMP, is so willing to lead this important initiative and build on the important work Steve has established. Please join me in congratulating Steve on his retirement and welcoming Aroutis to his new role.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nPaul E. Jensen, PhD\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\nNina Henderson Provost",

    "content": "This announcement was shared with faculty and staff on January 15, 2025.\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nAs we continue to work toward Drexel’s Academic Transformation and greater organizational consistency, I’m pleased to announce interim leadership in the Drexel University Libraries and Office of Research & Innovation.\n\nInterim Leadership of the Drexel University Libraries\n\nAfter one year leading the Drexel University Libraries, Interim University Librarian Ann Yurcaba will retire at the end of this month. I’m pleased to share that Pedro Raposo, PhD, Martha Hamilton and I. Wistar Morris III Executive Director of the Library & Archives of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University and an invited professor in the Department of History, has been appointed interim Head of University Libraries effective February 1, 2025.\n\nAt the Academy, Dr. Raposo has focused on transforming the Libraries & Archives — one of the most complete repositories of literature in the natural sciences in the United States — into a dynamic hub for research, teaching and learning through streamlined policies and strengthened partnerships, both across Drexel and with external organizations. He has played a key role in crafting a strategy for digital collections and access and steered the Academy’s Digital Collections Infrastructure signature initiative.\n\nPrior to joining Drexel, he was curator and director of collections at Chicago’s Adler Planetarium, where his exhibition work was awarded the 2016 Great Exhibitions Prize of the British Society for the History of Science; a researcher and lecturer at the University of Lisbon, Portugal; an education officer at the Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon; and a visiting scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Germany. He received a PhD in the history of science from the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, where he was awarded the Magellan Prize for his doctoral project.\n\nI would like to thank Ann Yurcaba for her leadership and ensuring a successful transition of library services and operations during a period of transition. Over the past year, the Libraries have implemented new Open Access publishing agreements with nine publishers, expanded Drexel’s Research repository, received the Library Excellence in Access and Diversity award, and reinforced the unit's commitment to its core mission and 2023-2025 strategic priorities, in alignment with Drexel’s 2030 strategic plan.\n\nIn addition to the resources and expertise provided by the Libraries, Drexel’s and the Academy’s vast collections and archives are valuable assets for research and teaching. Dr. Raposo will bring his expertise in these areas and work closely with Senior Vice Provost Ros Remer, PhD, to more closely align and coordinate these assets, with Dr. Remer serving as Senior Vice Provost for Libraries, Collections and Archives. Their work will further enrich Drexel’s innovative teaching and learning and expand access to the world-class facilities of the Academy.\n\nInterim Leadership of Research & Innovation\n\nAs previously announced, Executive Vice Provost for Research & Innovation Aleister Saunders, PhD, will be working closely with leadership in the College of Engineering, College of Computing & Informatics and the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems on operations and strategic matters as well as continued work in support of the Academic Transformation.\n\nWhile Dr. Saunders takes on that temporary assignment, Cassandra Myers, associate vice provost for research compliance and regulatory affairs, will take on additional responsibility in the Office of Research & Innovation. AVP Myers will lead various operational initiatives in the Office — including the CLARITY project and ongoing support for the Salus merger — and take on expanded responsibilities in existing functions including regulatory affairs, research integrity, and liaising with federal and state officials as well as engaging other key functions and teams.\n\nAdditionally, Rose Ann DiMaria-Ghalili, PhD, professor and senior associate dean for research in the College of Nursing and Health Professions, will serve as interim associate vice provost for research & innovation. Along with the ORI leadership team, Dr. DiMaria-Ghalili will act as a liaison between faculty researchers and the various administrative, technical, and operational teams that focus on research administration and innovation, supporting faculty members in efficiently conducting research within the institution's framework.\n\nTogether, the two leaders will ensure that ORI continues to meet the needs of our research community without interruption. I am grateful to both Rose Ann and Cassie for taking on these additional responsibilities during this time of transition.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Raposo, Dr. DiMaria-Ghalili and AVP Myers to their new/expanded roles!\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul E. Jensen, PhD\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\nNina Henderson Provost",

    "content": "This message was shared with all faculty and staff on January 6th, 2025.\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nI hope you had a restful and joyous winter break. As we welcome the new year, the Provost’s Office will be implementing a number of leadership and structural changes to support greater organizational consistency and alignment with University goals. Below are two important changes in the Office of Faculty Advancement and Graduate College.\n\nLeadership Changes in the Office of Faculty Advancement\n\nAfter nine years leading the Office of Faculty Advancement, Senior Vice Provost Erin McNamara Horvat, PhD, has stepped down from her role as senior vice provost for faculty advancement to return to the faculty. Vice Provost Leslie Ashburn Nardo, PhD, has been appointed vice provost for faculty advancement and inclusion, and will lead the Office of Faculty Advancement in addition to continuing to lead academic diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nDr. Horvat joined the Provost’s Office in 2016 to establish the University’s first Office of Faculty Affairs, part of efforts to better support faculty throughout the professional lifecycle. She has since identified and led several high-impact University initiatives. Dr. Horvat developed a leadership development program for academic leaders and collaborated with colleagues in Human Resources, the Office of the General Counsel and Faculty Senate to develop the Tenured Faculty Transition Plan, providing a coherent and predictable structure for tenured faculty to retire. Recognizing a need for greater policy infrastructure and processes, Dr. Horvat co-led efforts to establish a Policy on Policies and Drexel’s Policy Compliance Program.\n\nIn 2018, Dr. Horvat developed and launched the Teaching and Learning Center, which has advanced the culture of excellence and innovation in teaching at Drexel. She took on additional administrative roles, including overseeing undergraduate education during the COVID-19 pandemic. She was instrumental in moving the University to remote learning while collaborating with Student Life to provide a more integrated student experience. Dr. Horvat served as interim dean of the School of Education during a difficult time following the passing of Dean Penny Hammrich, and co-led the ELATES faculty leadership development program when it initially moved into the Provost’s portfolio.\n\nAn ethnographer and sociologist of education, Dr. Horvat will return to her faculty role in the School of Education and her research. I’m deeply grateful to Erin for her service and significant contributions to the University over the past nine years.\n\nSince joining the University as vice provost for diversity, equity and inclusion in 2022, Dr. Ashburn-Nardo has made significant contributions to enhancing faculty recruitment and advancement processes. She has helped steer a culture shift toward strategic, cross-unit cluster hiring, including piloting a Faculty Hiring Summit that brought together deans and Provost’s Office leaders in January 2023; another summit is planned for this month. As the current Drexel subaward PI of the National Science Foundation ADVANCE grant, “Partnership: Let's Talk Money: Building Community Understanding of the Institutional Compensation System,” she is leading an examination of faculty compensation processes with leaders from the academic units, Faculty Senate and Human Resources. Dr. Ashburn-Nardo is also Co-PI, with other Drexel collaborators, on a funding proposal submitted last fall to support equitable faculty advancement as a follow up to Drexel’s 2022 NSF ADVANCE Catalyst award led by Sharon Walker, PhD.\n\nCombining the DEI and faculty advancement roles in the Provost’s Office will help ensure that our efforts are fully integrated into our day-to-day work with faculty. More information will follow as Dr. Ashburn-Nardo develops her vision for reimagining the office. Please join me in thanking and welcoming Leslie to her new role!\n\nGraduate College to Become Office of Graduate Studies\n\nAs part of an effort to create more consistency in the organizational structure of the Provost’s Office, the Graduate College will be undergoing changes in the coming months. The Graduate College will now be known as the Office of Graduate Studies, housed in the Provost’s Office and led by Elisabeth Van Bockstaele, PhD, as senior vice provost for graduate studies. The Office of Graduate Studies will continue to support the functions of the Graduate College, including:\n\nWorking collaboratively with the colleges and schools, as well as central administrative units, to support the advancement of graduate education and to advocate for graduate student success.\n\nProviding academic support and guidance while helping to develop and disseminate policy changes among graduate students.\n\nWorking closely with graduate student organizations to develop academic, professional development that enhances the graduate student experience and builds community.\n\nAs a next step, the Office of Graduate Studies will collaborate with academic units and Student Success to better align graduate student support services across these units.\n\nI wish you all the best for a fulfilling start to the new year and term, and look forward to seeing the working groups kick off for Academic Transformation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul E. Jensen, PhD\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\nNina Henderson Provost",

    "content": "Commencement 2025 – The President’s Charge\n\nThe Commencement ceremony celebrates the achievements of each of our students, but it means much more.\n\nCommencement celebrates the accomplishments of a great academic community, a community where you have studied and worked together, in classrooms, laboratories, and studios…\n\nWhere you have listened to one another, challenged your beliefs, and allowed yourself to grow…\n\nAnd where you have made friends and pursued new interests.\n\nCommencement celebrates not only your accomplishments, but also the efforts of our outstanding faculty and staff whose dedication has helped lead you to this tremendous moment.\n\nIt also celebrates the love and commitment of those who have supported you – your family, your friends, and all the mentors you have had along the way.\n\nI’d like us to acknowledge all of these remarkable people, many of whom are with us here at Nickerson Field. I invite our newest graduates to stand once more, turn, and join me in recognizing your family and loved ones.\n\n***\n\nWe are living in uncertain times. Political shifts and technological advances create new challenges and opportunities. While only the present moment is certain, the pace of change is indeed fast. You are graduating in this turbulent moment, leaving the bubble of Boston University—your friends, acquaintances and the faculty and staff who care so much about you.\n\nI understand if you feel concerned or even a little fearful. But sit quietly and take a deep breath. Trust in all that you have learned and trust that your loved ones and this institution have provided you with knowledge, experience, and values that will carry you through.\n\nIn the words of the great former Dean of Marsh Chapel, Howard Thurman:\n\n“A [person] wants to know that [their] life’s purpose and plans are floored by a structure that is more than they are, that is comprehensive, significant, and good. When there is the assurance that such a structure has been found, then the sense of being adrift, of living a meaningless life, disappears.”\n\nFor Thurman, that structure is his spirituality, which may be the structure for some of you. I suggest that this university, with its commitment to discovery, knowledge, excellence, and service to society also imbues you with values that you can turn to when you feel adrift. In these uncertain times, I look to institutional ancestors—like Howard Thurman and Dr. King and their commitment to seeing the humanity and worth of all people. And, I look to our faculty, staff, and students and I no longer feel adrift—I find purpose.\n\nI encourage you to face the future with courage and purpose. Because you have tremendous support. Look around you, there are people who are here for you. You are graduating into one of the largest global alumni networks there is.\n\nAt matriculation, you became part of this institution. Upon graduation, your relationship grows and develops and does not end. I encourage you to return again and again.\n\nWhile this institution is always here for you, it is now my privilege to send you forth, out into the world.\n\nThere is no doubt that on each of our shoulders rests an enormous amount of responsibility.\n\nToday’s challenges and opportunities are many, they are complex, and they will require solutions from the most curious, compassionate, and caring people.\n\nI see all these things in you, the Boston University Class of 2025. You are the future of this University, this country, and this world.\n\nAnd, even as the challenges in front of us seem daunting, I am optimistic, because you will be among the next generation of leaders.\n\nAnd many of you are leading already. Among today’s graduates are members of the United States military; we thank you for your service. Also, among us are those who are commissioning into the Armed Services of the United States. You have chosen to dedicate yourselves to the protection of this country. This University is proud of you and gives you its sincerest gratitude. Wherever your tours of duty may take you, Godspeed.\n\nAnd to all the Class of 2025 — as you leave Nickerson Field, you join a long line of Boston University graduates stretching over time to include some 455,000 living alumni of this great institution.\n\nStay connected with us. Once a Terrier always a Terrier. Seek out fellow Boston University alumni. Come back to campus and celebrate fond memories of this wonderful place. And make new ones when you return.\n\nKnow that, as you move forward, your stumbles as well as your accomplishments will become part of the fabric of our legacy as a community marked by its eminence. Boston University is strong, and we will remain strong, because of our people, all of you included, and our values.\n\nAnd remember, too, that your Boston University education has prepared you to do great things.\n\nSo, go out into the world, confident that you have the tools to pursue excellence, wherever you go, and whatever you do.\n\nFind what speaks to you. And when it becomes clear what compels you, use your gifts to shine a light on others, too.\n\nBecause, collectively, we can do so much more good for others and this world, than if we go it alone.\n\nAgain, my most sincere congratulations to you and your loved ones. Enjoy all that you have accomplished.\n\nThis is a joyous day!\n\nAs delivered on May 18, 2025, at Nickerson Field.\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "Important Resources for Our Community\n\nApril 8, 2025\n\nDear Students, Faculty, and Staff,\n\nYesterday, BU Today published an article detailing resources that are available to members of our community who are immigrants, international, or are otherwise feeling vulnerable. I encourage everyone to read the article and familiarize themselves with University efforts to support those who have come to Boston University from other parts of the world, many of whom feel especially threatened in this moment. The article provides specific advice on safety planning, traveling, protests and social media, and emergency financial assistance, as well as what to do if approached by immigration enforcement and how to access legal support. I’ve included information on the latter two points below. You may also visit our Federal Actions website, which we continue to update with the latest information.\n\nAs I said in BU Today, the safety of all our students, faculty, and staff is our highest priority, as is their security and privacy. Our immigrant and international students, faculty, and staff are deeply valuable to our community; we would not be the strong university that we are today without the many perspectives and talents that they bring with them to campus.\n\nMany of you have questions about how Boston University would work with the federal government regarding inquiries on international students. The Boston University Police Department (BUPD) does not enforce federal immigration law and will never ask an individual about their immigration status. Moreover, personally identifiable information from student education records and faculty and staff personnel records, as well as other personal information, is protected by various state and federal privacy laws, which we take extremely seriously.\n\nHere’s what you can do if a law enforcement official approaches you or a fellow community member on campus: Ask the official to wait somewhere appropriate while you contact BUPD, which will then work with the Office of the General Counsel and other University offices to address the request in accordance with the law. If you are unable to wait for BUPD assistance, you may ask the law enforcement official to contact BUPD themselves.\n\nFor those with legal concerns about their immigration status, the International Students & Scholars Office provides guidance and information about experienced immigration attorneys in the area.\n\nThis time in our country is uncertain. Rapid changes to federal policies are calling into question many of the very foundational values and missions of colleges and universities nationwide. And I know that many of you are afraid. As an administration, we will protect our faculty, staff, and students to the best of our ability, and together, let us all continue to look out for one another.\n\nAs we move forward, we must remain resolute and committed to Boston University’s founding belief that higher education should be accessible to all individuals who meet our admissions standards, and that we are stronger because we come from so many different backgrounds and have different experiences.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam\n\nPresident\n\n*4/8/25 This message was sent to students, faculty, and staff.\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "Steps to Support BU’s Financial Health\n\nMarch 26, 2025\n\nDear Members of Boston University’s Faculty and Staff,\n\nOver the past few months, we have communicated with you about the University’s budget. As we move through the budget process, we want to be transparent about our findings and the steps we will take to address our short- and long-term financial health.\n\nOverall, our University has a strong financial foundation. However, we are not immune to the realities affecting many of our peer institutions. There are a variety of pressures on our budget, many of which have built over time, and other challenges that have emerged more recently.\n\nImmediately, we will take steps to balance the budget. We will adjust upcoming enrollment targets, look for additional revenue opportunities, and decrease spending. In addition, we have made the very difficult decision not to provide annual merit increases this year for faculty and staff. We know that merit increases are important to our community members and that this news is difficult. We did not enter this decision lightly, but it will allow us to mitigate potential layoffs. Yet, these broad solutions are not enough. Later today, we will share specific instructions with department leaders regarding budget reduction targets, and in the coming months, we will examine our budget model and further hone the University’s strategic vision.\n\nBudget Information\n\nWhile we have communicated frequently about the budget, we know that many of you may be surprised and have questions. With that in mind, we want to share some detailed information that may provide helpful context.\n\nThe University develops its annual budget with a goal to cover expenses and set aside enough in reserves for planned strategic investments. This basic and prudent practice has allowed us to pursue new ideas and seize opportunities that have contributed to our progress through the years. These reserves are critical to sustaining the University’s competitive position and maintaining the quality of our academic and research programs. They are used for the day-to-day operations of the University and to support current or future commitments and investments, including faculty start-up packages and recruitment, academic initiatives, research centers, revenue-sharing agreements with schools and colleges, laboratory and classroom renovations, and other capital projects.\n\nSince Fiscal Year 2022, Boston University’s reserves have dropped significantly, and they are expected to drop even further this year.\n\nThere are several reasons for these declines:\n\nInflation has had a significant impact on our expenses, which have grown much faster than our revenues since pandemic restrictions were lifted in 2022.\n\nMaster’s degree enrollments are down compared to budgeted targets, as they are at colleges and universities across the country. Last fall, our master’s programs missed revenue targets by $38 million, based on lower enrollments due to fewer applicants and unusually low yield. Unfortunately, this is a trend that we and many of our peers must continue to account for moving forward.\n\nSalaries and wages have increased more than anticipated.\n\nStabilizing the University’s new Student Information System has been costly. This year, we anticipate spending $13 million in one-time funding to realign the project and get it back on track. Additionally, we will allocate $2.7 million annually to maintain the system’s optimal performance.\n\nWe are graduating one of our largest classes of undergraduate students, admitted in the fall of 2021, which has helped to offset inflationary pressures in recent years. Further constraints on our housing inventory, due to the renovation of Warren Towers over the next three years, will limit our ability to accommodate similarly large classes in the immediate future.\n\nWe will have an opportunity to answer questions about our finances during the Spring Town Hall for staff on Monday, March 31, and later that day at the Faculty Assembly.\n\nNext Steps\n\nGiven these factors and national uncertainties, it is likely that universities will face more budgetary challenges in Fiscal Year 2026 and beyond. Thus, following the immediate steps described above, we will begin strategic planning and a close examination of our budget model. As you know, we are not alone in the financial challenges that face higher education. Many institutions are taking steps to prepare for potential shortfalls. We, too, must be deliberate about our operations and make decisions that best promote our highest priorities to achieve the future we envision.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWhile these times are challenging, we cannot retreat. Boston University’s commitment to helping society is more important than ever. If we are to continue leading in research, scholarship, teaching, learning, and service, we must take this moment to rethink how we operate, allowing us to achieve even greater success.\n\nWe are entering a critical period that will require creative thinking and innovative approaches to reach our current and future goals. Many efforts are already underway, such as our vision to strengthen our partnership with Boston Medical Center. This collaboration will help us reduce duplication, streamline processes, and leverage our important role in Boston’s healthcare landscape.\n\nAs a bold and dynamic institution, we are known for overcoming challenges and making things happen. Our culture of creativity and innovation will continue to serve us well, as it has in the past. We remain confident in our future because of you—our dedicated faculty and staff—who are vital to our shared mission. Thank you for everything you do for our community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam, President\n\nGloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nNicole Tirella, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\n\n*3/26/25 This message was sent to faculty and staff.\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "Supporting Our Mission\n\nDear Members of Boston University’s Faculty and Staff,\n\nAs many students return from spring break, I am writing to address several issues currently affecting our University and other institutions throughout the nation.\n\nBudget Pressures\n\nEarlier this semester, I announced that we would slow spending in response to our budgetary challenges. A confluence of factors and external pressures affecting Boston University and higher ed more generally have led us to this moment. As I mentioned in my prior messages, the Student Information System implementation, shrinking graduate enrollments, inflationary pressures, and other factors have contributed to the need for fiscal controls. As we look forward, we must also be mindful of changes happening in Washington that could have a further impact on our financial health. For these reasons, it is critical for us to take additional measures to align our spending and revenue.\n\nEarlier this year, I charged Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer Nicole Tirella with analyzing our fiscal constraints and evaluating a range of options to address them. Next week, we will share budget targets for academic and administrative leaders and work together to identify additional strategies for revenue generation and cost reduction to ensure our long-term success.\n\nShifting Federal Policies\n\nMany of you have expressed concerns regarding actions taken by the federal government. Please be assured that University Provost Gloria Waters and I are working closely with our government relations teams, in Washington and Boston, as well as with other institutions, to navigate shifting federal policies and their implications. I have established an Issues Response Team that informs our academic and administrative leaders of pressures facing our institution. For those seeking further information, I encourage you to review the FAQs we have developed and are updating regularly.\n\nCommitment to Our Values\n\nAs we take steps to comply with changes to federal law and policy, I am aware that some have questioned the administration’s commitment to the diversity and inclusivity of the University. To address these concerns, I point to our core values. Boston University was founded on the belief that higher education should be accessible to all. Our founders envisioned a university where no qualified individual—regardless of race, religion, or sex—would be turned away. This commitment has included all people regardless of background, gender identity, sexual orientation, or country of origin. This foundational commitment to identify and nurture talented individuals from all backgrounds while ensuring they can fully engage in our environment remains at the heart of who we are and must continue to be. Nevertheless, we can do even more to make certain that our people thrive and that we serve our surrounding community.\n\nMany of you have also expressed concerns about free speech, particularly related to the issues of the day. I want to reaffirm that our commitment to free expression is unwavering. To paraphrase our first president, William Fairfield Warren, speech is the primary means by which we bring to life the ideals of character and purpose. Since our inception, we have been steadfast in our commitment to the importance of free speech, and this commitment will continue to guide us.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nDespite these headwinds, the University must continue to advance, in support of our mission and our promising future. There is a lot to do in the final months of the semester. We will develop a strategic framework focused on excellence in academics, talent, and operations to maintain our momentum and steward resources effectively. The provost and I will reorganize our offices for greater impact and efficiency, while completing leadership searches for academic deans, advancement, and communications to strengthen our ability to lead, raise money, and communicate strategically during this critical time.\n\nFinally, I want to express my sincere gratitude for your willingness to share your thoughts, concerns, and constructive criticism. Your insights into the University are invaluable. I firmly believe that true growth is achieved by overcoming adversity. I am profoundly thankful that Boston University is a place where groundbreaking research thrives and where the next generation of leaders are equipped to confront the critical issues of our time. I am equally appreciative of our people and their unwavering commitment to discovery, innovation, education, and service.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam\n\nPresident\n\n*3/19/25 This message was sent to faculty and staff.\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "Launching the Task Force on Convergent Research and Education\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\nDear Members of the Boston University Community,\n\nWe are pleased to announce the launch of the Boston University Task Force on Convergent Research and Education. This initiative will build upon our University’s strong foundation in impactful and collaborative work across disciplines. Convergent research integrates diverse fields—from, and not limited to, the sciences, engineering, and medicine to public policy and business—to address scientific questions and help solve complex societal challenges. Boston University’s researchers who work in this way have already driven breakthroughs in health, synthetic biology, neurophotonics, climate science, and AI.\n\nThe task force will be charged with making recommendations on how to best adopt convergence, University-wide and within individual schools and colleges. This effort will further our ability to make transformative contributions to society, remain highly competitive for external funding for our research and educational programs, excel in educating the future workforce, and continue attracting intellectually fearless and ambitious faculty and students to our University.\n\nThe task force will be charged with seeking the valuable perspectives of faculty and staff from across the University. In addition, the task force will have the following objectives:\n\nDetermine how to position BU so we remain a leader in convergent research, including gathering information about effective practices adopted at peer institutions and developing strategies for identifying new and emergent areas for convergent research and education Identify current organizational barriers to convergent research and teaching that can be removed to make it easier for researchers from different fields and across our campuses to collaborate effectively Recommend key investments from Boston University and external partners to catalyze success in convergent research and education Determine best approaches for recruiting new talent and developing current faculty Examine the role convergence should play to enhance undergraduate and graduate educational programs and better prepare graduates to embrace the power of working across disciplines Identify metrics, short- and long-term, that could be used to measure and track success of our efforts over time\n\nWe are grateful to the task force members for their service and especially to cochairs Ken Lutchen, professor of biomedical engineering and senior advisor to the president for strategy and innovation, and Darrell Kotton, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine.\n\nWe have asked the task force to share their initial set of recommendations by July 1, 2025, which we look forward to sharing broadly with the University community. From there, we will work together to implement their most compelling ideas.\n\nWe are confident that with this focused initiative, in conjunction with our proven history of excellence in research, we will develop an institutional strategy for convergence that charts a bold future for research, leverages and builds on our many strengths, and uniquely positions Boston University to achieve eminence in this area for years to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam, President\n\nGloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nBoston University Task Force on Convergent Research and Education\n\nCochairs:\n\nDarrell Kotton, Professor of Medicine, Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine; Director, Center for Regenerative Medicine\n\nKenneth Lutchen, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering; Senior Advisor to the President for Strategy & Innovation\n\nMembers:\n\nDavid Boas, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering; Director, Neurophotonics Center\n\nDeborah Carr, Arts & Sciences Distinguished Professor of Sociology, College of Arts & Sciences; Director, Center for Innovation in Social Science\n\nChristopher Chen, William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor; Professor of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering\n\nKevin Gallagher, Professor of Global Development Policy, Frederick S.

    "content": "Update on Financial Outlook\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nI am writing today to provide an update on our financial outlook and share the steps we are taking to ensure Boston University continues to thrive. Despite an overall positive financial position, as we look to the future it is essential that we slow spending and focus our resources on our highest priorities.\n\nHistorically, our budgeting approach has allowed us to build strong reserves and invest in critical priorities, such as faculty hiring, financial aid, and infrastructure. However, as I communicated in my State of the University message, this year, due to several factors—including the Student Information System implementation, graduate enrollment shortfalls, increased cost of labor, and inflation—we anticipate that our year-end reserves will fall short of our budget target and similar pressures will carry forward into the next fiscal year. Additionally, the new and evolving regulatory environment has created economic uncertainty and potential budget pressures.\n\nIn response, we have introduced new fiscal controls and are asking that everyone evaluate how they can reduce spending and use resources more efficiently. Nicole Tirella, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, will oversee this process. I want to stress that Boston University continues to have a strong financial foundation. These spending controls are necessary to ensure that BU continues to be financially sound and that we are able to remain focused on our core mission in the months and years ahead.\n\nThese times call on us to sharpen our strategy, increase operational excellence, and identify activities and practices that no longer serve us. I encourage each of you to stay focused on what matters most—our people, our work, and the impact we make on the world. Thank you for your ongoing commitment to Boston University. I remain optimistic about the future, knowing that our greatest asset—our people—will drive our continued success.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMelissa Gilliam\n\nPresident\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "In Support of Research\n\nFebruary 11, 2025\n\nDear Members of the Boston University Community:\n\nAs you may have seen in the news, last Friday the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new policy that would cut research funding for facilities and administration costs. As researchers ourselves, we share your concerns about this announcement from the NIH and its potential implications. We want to assure you that the University is moving quickly to assess the impact of this news on our research and taking the steps necessary to support our community and respond thoughtfully and effectively.\n\nYesterday, three lawsuits — including one from the Association of American Universities (AAU), an association of leading research universities in North America — were filed in federal court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking an injunction against this new NIH policy that limits indirect cost reimbursement for NIH research studies to 15 percent. As an AAU member on whose behalf the case was filed, we strongly support this case.\n\nAs of last evening, the court had ruled on two of the lawsuits, granting a temporary restraining order preventing the implementation of the limit nationwide.\n\nThe funding that Boston University receives from the NIH supports critical and cutting-edge medical research that helps improve human health and save lives. At BU, the NIH has supported the Framingham Heart Study, one of the leading studies in understanding cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, as well as impactful research that has led to better outcomes for patients struggling with cancer, pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nThe changes proposed by the NIH and the very brief timeline for their implementation could have a seriously adverse effect on these operations and many others. Boston University is committed to supporting the groundbreaking work being done by our researchers in labs across our campuses and around the world, and we want you to know this remains a top priority for us as an institution.\n\nOf course, the impact of these proposed changes would be felt far beyond our own campus. Not only could this policy have real ramifications on research projects that improve human life, but it could also affect the United States’ standing in the global scientific community. Our nation has a long history of our government working closely with our colleges and universities — this partnership is why the United States has long been the world’s leader in furthering groundbreaking scientific research. It is crucial that this relationship remains strong.\n\nAs with other recent federal research program changes, the situation is evolving quickly, and we are committed to keeping our community informed. We have been in regular communication with our researchers as new policy changes have been announced and will continue to provide updates and FAQs on the Office of Research website.\n\nWe are grateful to be a part of a community of people who have the compassion to devote their lives to helping others, and the talent and expertise to create real, positive change through their work.\n\nYour commitment to advancing knowledge and discovery makes us all stronger. Know that we are here to support you every step of the way and that we will continue to advocate on behalf of research excellence at Boston University.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam, President\n\nGloria Waters, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer\n\nThomas Bifano, Vice President and Associate Provost Ad Interim for Research\n\n* 2/11/25 This message was sent to students, faculty, and staff.\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "Welcome Back and Thoughts on the Spring Semester\n\nJanuary 29, 2025\n\nDear Members of the Boston University Community,\n\nWelcome back to campus. I hope that your intersession was restful and restorative and that you were able to spend joyful moments with loved ones. I am looking forward to a productive, engaging semester and especially to continuing to get to know you and this University.\n\nEven as we return to campus with anticipation, many are feeling the stress of personal struggles and world events. For the members of our community in Greater Los Angeles, the new year has brought tremendous loss and destruction due to wildfires. We are also concerned about the effects of new executive orders and policies and how they will influence higher education, research, migration, and the campus community. Many are impacted by the conflicts and tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East, or other parts of the world.\n\nWhatever the cause, I have heard from you and know that it is a time of stress, worry, and personal loss.\n\nThe news of the day feels relentless, and it can be especially intrusive while we are all working so hard toward our individual and collective goals. If you are suffering, I encourage you to seek out resources that are available to you, including Crisis Counseling at 617-353-3569, the University Chaplains office at 617-353-3560, or the Faculty & Staff Assistance Office at 617-353-5381.\n\nOur University’s impact and our eminence require focus and urgency. We must prioritize people—our faculty, staff, and students. We must aspire to leadership in research, scholarship, teaching, and learning. Finally, we must commit to operational excellence so that we are nimble and resilient.\n\nThese considerations are shaping the University’s response to the present challenges. As we have done with other natural disasters and crises, we have reached out directly to those people who have been affected by the events in Los Angeles. We delayed the start of our program in Los Angeles for a few days and now the program is back on track. You can learn more about how BU is supporting its LA community members in this story from BU Today.\n\nAs we would with any change in administration, our Federal Relations office is in close contact with policymakers and experts in our nation’s capital to understand any changes in policy and how they might affect our research and community. You can keep abreast of the work we are doing in Federal Relations by signing up for their newsletter, Beltway BUzz. In addition, last semester, I convened a group of leaders from across the University to meet regularly to track ongoing issues in higher education, understand their implications for Boston University, and develop action plans for the University to move forward with our core missions of research, scholarship, and academics, thoughtfully and skillfully.\n\nAt the same time, I want you to know how optimistic I am about Boston University and its future. I am hopeful because every day I see what each of you does to benefit one another, our surrounding communities, and the world. My optimism also stems from our critical history as an institution founded on the principle of being open, accessible, and inclusive of all. Boston University is a particular and rare academic environment in which we care for ideas and one another.\n\nLet us use our traditions as a guide: As we begin a new semester in earnest, let us be open to the free exchange of ideas and to civil discourse. Let us foster inclusivity ensuring differing ideas can be expressed and explored. And let us take our novel ideas beyond our campus walls through research, internships, community service, the arts, and patient care. As our inaugural president William Fairfield Warren said, the purpose of the University, is to realize “the highest known ideals in individual and social character and life,” and to “propagat[e] these ideals from one generation to another, and from one land to another, so long as the world shall stand.”\n\nBoston University was founded to be what we are today: a community where curious, intelligent, and compassionate people from all backgrounds come together to discover, learn, and serve. Our enduring values and traditions can guide us into the future. Let us take care of each other and support one another. I wish all of you the very best for a productive, engaging, and joy-filled spring semester.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelissa Gilliam\n\nPresident\n\n*1/29/25 This message was sent to students, faculty, and staff.\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "MLK Day Celebration: Reflections on “The Darkness at Midnight”\n\nThank you Nick [Bates] for that introduction. We are grateful for your leadership of the Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground, which, for nearly 40 years, has been one of Boston University’s jewels.\n\nThe Center is the University’s cultural hub, an inclusive space that encourages young people to step outside of their comfort zone, and to build relationships and to share their experiences with others.\n\nThis is what we do at universities. We bring people from all over the world, from all walks of life, and we form community and lifelong relationships.\n\nThank you, too, for hosting today’s event. This is the perfect venue to celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr., who famously called Howard Thurman a mentor and a friend. Certainly, Dean Thurman had a significant influence on King, and the path towards justice that he chose to follow throughout his life.\n\nThank you to Mayor Wu and the City of Boston, the Dean of Students Office, Government and Community Affairs, and the BU Libraries Special Collections for their co-sponsorship of today’s celebration.\n\nWe are honored to call the City of Boston our home, and to work closely with Mayor Wu and her team on issues of peace and prosperity, and to find ways to make our communities safer, healthier, more sustainable, more affordable, and more accessible for everyone.\n\nThese goals that we share are not so different from the ones that Dr. King fought so hard for…\n\n***\n\n… Today’s theme is “The Darkness at Midnight,” which takes inspiration from Dr. King’s speech “A Knock at Midnight.”\n\nI’d like you, for a moment, to imagine yourself in a pew at the Mt. Zion Baptist Church. I invite you to close your eyes if it feels right for you to do so.\n\nIt’s February 11, 1962, one of the several times Dr. King is reported to have given this talk, and he has just taken his place in the pulpit.\n\nAs you imagine yourself seated in the church, among the parishioners, perhaps you have invited friends to come with you, you hear the melodic baritone and building cadence of Dr. King’s voice, as he begins his exegesis on the Gospel of Luke.\n\n“I come this morning to try to preach,” he begins, “and I would like for all others, men and women alike, to think with me from the subject: ‘A Knock at Midnight.’”\n\nDr. King goes on to tell the parable of a man who, in his time of need, goes to his neighbor to seek bread because he is hungry.\n\nThe man’s knocks, made at midnight, go unanswered, and the man is left alone, hungry, perhaps without hope, certainly surrounded by darkness.\n\nAs you, along with Dr. King, feel the cold that has enveloped the man in Luke’s scripture, I’d also invite you to place yourself in the historical context of King’s speech as best you can.\n\nAs King continues to speak, you begin to hear him talk about a society in a moral, spiritual, and psychological “state of chaos.”\n\n“We are experiencing a darkness so deep that we can hardly see which way to turn,” he says.\n\nLater, he laments that, “The great problem of mankind today is still, there is too much hatred around.”\n\nThe year was 1962.\n\nHe has taken the pulpit during the heart of the civil rights movement. It is less than a year following the Freedom Rides, and a few months prior to the integration of the University of Mississippi.\n\nI can relate to this year, it is just one year after my own mother, Dorothy Butler Gilliam, became the first Black woman to work as a reporter for the Washington Post. It was such a good thing that they had hired her in 1961. Because she was able to go to Mississippi and cover the integration of Old Miss and meet with families and people throughout the community to tell a story that otherwise the Washington Post’s readers would not have heard.\n\nWhile King preached of darkness, there was already light…\n\n***\n\nI invite you, now, to let that hard sentiment stay with you, as you return back to 2025.\n\nOpen your eyes if they were closed, and look around at where we find ourselves today, back in Metcalf Hall, in the George Sherman Union.\n\nWhat do you see? A room filled with love and concern and caring. A room full of people from all walks of life, and backgrounds, and beliefs who are sitting here in community.\n\nI’m not a theologian, but King talked about the other side of the “dirty shade of gray” that is “midnight in the moral order” for King, which is the dawning of a new morning.\n\nLet me tell you something, I woke up this morning and it was so dark outside, the realities of the day started to rush in, and then the sun rose, and it was a beautiful morning. Yes, there are wildfires, wars, unhoused people, and poverty. But there is also great beauty.\n\nSo, let me tell you a bit about yesterday. Yesterday, I was greeted by the staff and faculty of Boston University’s Wheelock College of Education. They taught me about their long, long history of deaf education and scholarship.\n\nThey taught me about the tradition of giving a sign name so one does not have to spell out all of the individual letters of a name. But also to signify belonging to this distinct and special community. I was invited into the deaf community and given a sign name. So yes, Dr. King, there is too much hatred, but there is so much love.\n\nWhile it is dark at midnight, I am already standing in the light.\n\n***\n\nDr. King, of course, largely found his own solace, and a right path forward, through scripture.\n\nAt Boston University, we can look to our history, to our founding values, and to the words of leaders who have come before us, to understand this light.\n\nOur Founding President William Fairfield Warren, called the University a society, “realizing the highest known ideals in individual and social character and life, and of propagating these ideals from one generation to another, and from one land to another, so long as the world shall stand.”\n\nI love this quotation for its aspiration; it sets a high standard for us to reach for. And historically, the people of Boston University, and this institution, have aimed high, and at times achieved greatness.\n\nFrom its beginning, Boston University has championed a diversity of backgrounds, identities, experiences, and perspectives, which is essential to learning. We have championed free speech and listening to ideas and viewpoints with which we disagree.\n\nKnowing more about others who are different from us, and hearing genuine, real perspectives that are new to us, are both so important to putting the chaos of misinformation and hate at bay. There is nothing more beautiful or profound than learning to love, overcoming hate.\n\nKing came here to Boston University because he saw these values reflected in the people and the scholarship of our institution.\n\nDr. King and his mentor Dean Thurman both believed that a common humanity could bind us together, despite our differences.\n\nYet, how do we build this sense of trust? How do we find our common humanity?\n\nIn my mind, there is no better way than through service.\n\nIn 1957, in Montgomery, Alabama, Dr. King famously called “Life’s most persistent and urgent question… ‘What are you doing for others?’””\n\nIn one of his final sermons before his death, King said from the pulpit of his beloved Ebenezer Baptist Church,\n\n“If you want to be important—wonderful. If you want to be recognized—wonderful. If you want to be great—wonderful. But recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. That’s a new definition of greatness. By giving that definition of greatness, it means that everybody can be great, because everybody can serve… You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love. And you can be that servant.”\n\nOne of the reasons that I am so filled with joy is that I can serve others. First as a physician, scholar, and educator. And now as the leader of this university.\n\nI know that many of us in this room, from Boston University, from Mayor Wu’s Office in the City of Boston, and others here celebrating the legacy of this incredible man… We share his vision of service as the highest ideal for us to aspire to.\n\nAt Boston University, it’s in our mission statement, that “we are committed to generating new knowledge to benefit society… and that “higher education should… be conducted in the service of the wider community—local and international.”\n\nAs I look around the room today, I see all kinds of people devoted to service: public servants, educators, students who volunteer in their communities, staff members who work tirelessly to keep our students safe and to ensure that they have what they need from their college experience.\n\nYes, Dr. King, there is too much hate. But that will always be true because one iota of hate is too much hate. But oh my friends, there is so much love. Let us face the challenges of today, together, let us face this new morning, together, and let us continue to serve others.\n\nWe are bound by our commitment to make a difference in the world.\n\nAs delivered on January 25, 2025 at GSU Metcalf Hall.\n\nView all posts",

    "content": "David Warner, one of the College of Medicine's newest Doctor of Medicine graduates, is no stranger to hard work, perseverance and leadership. This spring, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Graduate Student Excellence (PMGSE) — one of only two recipients university-wide this year.\n\nThe moment Warner learned about the award is one he won’t soon forget. “I was completely taken by surprise,” he said.\n\nHe was expecting a routine meeting with Dawn Bragg, PhD, associate dean of student affairs. Instead, he walked into a surprise celebration organized by the Student Affairs office.\n\n“I was left speechless!\" said Warner. \"It’s an incredible honor to represent the College of Medicine, and I hope it inspires other students to apply in the future.”\n\nThroughout his medical school journey, Warner fully embraced every opportunity to learn, lead and serve. His passion for medical education and nephrology was fueled through his work with the Curriculum Committee, Association of American Medical Colleges Organization of Student Representatives, the Nephrology Medical Student Scholars Program and leadership roles with the American Medical Association. He also found purpose in advocating for and mentoring his peers, always looking for ways to strengthen the student voice.\n\nOne of the defining experiences of his time at UC was serving on the Curriculum Committee for four years — a role he describes as one of the greatest privileges of his medical education.\n\n“Collaborating with faculty, administrators and staff to continuously improve our curriculum showed me how much UC CoM truly values the student voice,” he said.\n\nAnother highlight was co-delivering an opening plenary talk at the 2022 Association of American Medical Colleges Renew, Rebuild, Restore Conference, where he represented CoM on a national stage to address restoring humanity and trust in medicine.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech for the presidential medal, Warner shared a message that has resonated throughout his time at UC: “The most powerful medicine we can offer is spending time at the bedside with our patients and their families.” His words were even quoted by UC President Neville Pinto, PhD, during the College of Medicine’s 2025 Honors Day ceremony, underscoring the profound impact of Warner’s reflections on the broader medical community.\n\n“This speaks volumes about the deeper calling your faculty have woven into your education,” President Pinto told the Class of 2025. “You graduate not only with skill, but with humanity.”\n\nWarner’s journey has also been marked by personal growth, including navigating imposter syndrome as a first-generation and non-traditional student. “I learned that when confronted with imposter syndrome, you can let it inhibit you — or let it fuel you,” he reflected during his PMGSE acceptance speech. “I am standing here today because I chose the latter.”\n\nLooking ahead, Warner is excited to continue his training at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center as an internal medicine resident — a true full-circle moment. Before medical school, Warner worked as a laboratory technologist at Litholink, a company co-founded by John Asplin, who completed his residency at UC before becoming a leader in nephrology.\n\n“I’m thrilled to be able to train with pioneers in medical education and nephrology at the institution that inspired me early on,” said Warner.\n\nWhen asked what advice he’d share with incoming students, Warner offered a simple but powerful reminder: “Be someone you would want to work with. Be curious, be humble, be willing to learn, be willing to help your team and most importantly — be kind. This will carry you far.”\n\nAs he moves forward in his career, Warner is committed to carrying the lessons of UC CoM with him — continuing to lead with integrity, curiosity and compassion.",

    "content": "The presentation of the Business Partnership Award was followed by recognition of the Distinguished Service Awardee. From classroom visits to student mentorship, Liz Keating maintains close ties to Lindner and UC. As Keating stressed in her remarks, she is largely driven to do so by the legacy of her father.\n\n“Getting involved with Lindner has given me the opportunity to learn from some of Cincinnati's greatest leaders who are giving their time to carry out the legacy of Mr. Lindner,” said Keating. “And I am much of who I am today because I have been surrounded by Bearcats and those who have given their time to this university, and particularly to the Lindner College of Business.”\n\nThe final and highest honor of the evening was presented by Jennifer Heisey, UC’s Chief Alumni Officer. As the highest honor a Lindner alumnus may receive, the Carl H. Lindner Award for Outstanding Business Achievement recognizes a Lindner graduate who exemplifies success in their profession and field of business, and showcases ample dedication to entrepreneurship and their community. The 2025 Carl H. Lindner Award for Outstanding Business Achievement went to Rusty Myers, Bus ’82, recognizing his contributions to the Cincinnati real estate community and his deep ties to Lindner and UC.\n\n“As you can probably tell, I bleed red and black, and I am grateful to the College of Business for preparing me as a student and for being by my side ever since,” said Myers upon accepting the award. “I have served alongside an army of volunteers at the business college, the real estate program, the Alumni Association, and the UC Foundation over the years, and this wonderful Carl H. Lindner Award is not just about me, it is a tribute to everyone who has walked before me and with me over the years.”\n\nAs the evening ended, there was even more to celebrate as Lewis returned to the stage to announce the creation of a new endowed scholarship for Lindner students made possible by the funds raised from this and past CBAAs.\n\nFeatured image: Left to right: UC President Pinto, Carl H.

    "content": "Mr. Rector, members of the Board of Visitors, students, colleagues, family, friends – welcome to Final Exercises.\n\nMy name is Jim Ryan, and in addition to being the president of UVA, I am your host for today’s ceremony, and I will also officially award the degrees.\n\nToday marks the end of the 196th Academic Session, and we are here to celebrate and confer degrees on students from nine of the University’s schools: the School of Medicine, the School of Law, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, the School of Architecture, the School of Nursing, the McIntire School of Commerce, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and the School of Data Science. Yesterday, we conferred degrees for the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, the School of Education and Human Development, and the Frank Batten School of Public Policy.\n\nToday, we celebrate students and families who worked hard to get to this point, including some who overcame enormous challenges. Everyone here has a story to tell. One of today’s graduates, for example, is a father earning his bachelor’s degree 24 hours after his daughter walked the Lawn yesterday. Some are veterans, completing their education after serving our country. Others are the first in their family to graduate from college. We have one graduate who is 80 years old and several who are 19.\n\nAll of those stories – all of your stories – are important, and every graduate here has earned this moment of celebration, as have their families.\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to acknowledge graduating student-athletes who cannot be here today, including members of our baseball, softball, men’s tennis, women’s golf, rowing, and track and field teams, who are competing this weekend. Go Hoos!\n\nI’d also like to remember four members of this class who passed away before they were able to graduate: Michael McFarlane, who is receiving a posthumous degree from the School of Data Science; Marc Rockwell-Pate, who studied in the Darden School of Business; Tessa Wiseman, at UVA Law; and Vidhi Agarwal, who was admitted to Darden, but passed away before she could enroll. These students will be remembered and honored here by all those whose lives they touched.\n\nI would also like to recognize several University leaders who are retiring or departing this year, including Provost Ian Baucom, University Librarian and Dean of Libraries John Unsworth, interim Dean of Students Cedric Rucker, Dean of the McIntire School of Commerce Nicole Thorne Jenkins, and Senior Vice President for Operations and State Government Relations Colette Sheehy. Each of these leaders has shaped the University in profound ways, and I’m grateful to them for their service.\n\nFinally, I’d like to offer some thanks.\n\nFirst, thank you to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Band from Fort Eustis, Virginia, which is performing our music today. Please join me in a round of applause for them, as well as for the members of our ROTC programs who presented the colors.\n\nThanks also to the UVA Sustainability office and our Balloon Brigade volunteers for collecting balloons for UVA Health Children’s today.\n\nI would also like to offer a huge thanks to our talented staff, who work hard all year and then put in tremendous effort to make our Grounds look especially beautiful for this weekend and to make this ceremony special for all of you.\n\nParticular thanks are due to Cecil Banks, our director of major events, and his team.\n\nI’d also like to thank our outstanding faculty, who have served not simply as teachers and colleagues, but also as mentors and friends. Please join me in giving our staff and faculty a big round of applause.\n\nNearly 4,000 graduates from nine schools take part in the final day of celebrations of the UVA Class of 2025 on Sunday. (Photo by Matt Riley, University Communications)\n\nIf you will indulge me, I’d also like to ask you a favor. Today is my daughter Phebe’s birthday. I wonder if, on the count of three, you can say “Happy Birthday, Phebe”?\n\nSpeaking of family, I’d also like to take a moment to congratulate and thank all the parents and grandparents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, family and friends in the audience today. Together, you have supported our students – your students – in countless ways. You have helped pay tuition, you have offered encouragement, you have fed them when they are home on break, and you have nudged them when they needed nudging.\n\nThis has been a momentous journey for everyone, including all of you. No one makes it to graduation on their own. To all the families and friends of our students: Today is your day, too, which is why I would like to ask all of our graduating students to stand, turn toward the audience, and give a round of applause to those who helped you on this journey.\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, I’d like to offer my sincere congratulations and gratitude to the talented and passionate Class of 2025. You have been through highs and lows during your time at UVA, starting your first year as the effects of the pandemic lingered, and enduring the tragic shooting in 2022, which injured Mike Hollins and Marlee Morgan, who is graduating today, and cost the lives of three fellow students, Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis, Jr. and D’Sean Perry, who we remember and honor today.\n\nYou are entering a world that is uncertain and somewhat volatile, as many graduating classes have in the past. You cannot always control what happens, but you can control what you do in response. I know you will choose wisely and courageously, because you have done so time and again while on Grounds. The grace and strength of your class has held this community together through times of grief and times of celebration.\n\nI hope and trust that you will look back on your years here as some of the most important and life-changing years of your lives, and that you will remember both the joys and the challenges. There is, after all, much joy to be found in this world, as you have already shown us. Most importantly, you have made this university a better place, and I have no doubt you will do the same for the world you are about to enter.\n\nWith that, let’s begin this honorable and joyous ceremony, through which we will welcome all of you into the worldwide community of University of Virginia graduates.\n\nRyan poses for a selfie with one of the newest UVA graduates. (Photo by Matt Riley, University Communications)\n\nAfter remarks from guest speakers and the conferring of degrees, Ryan returned to the stage for closing comments.\n\nThank you to the Seven Society for that very generous and meaningful gift, which will help our students take advantage of everything UVA has to offer.\n\nAnd thank you, Tatia, for your remarks. We are fortunate to have a strong and tight-knit community of alumni whose time on Grounds profoundly shaped their lives. I’m grateful that so many of those alumni have worked hard to give others the same experience.\n\nI’d like to say a final thank you to our grand marshal, professor Beth Meyer, and to all of today’s speakers and performers.\n\nI recognize that I am the only person standing between you and celebrating with your friends and family, which is why I will keep my final remarks to a short and crisp 45 to 60 minutes.\n\nActually, I have just one final and simple request for this graduating class, which is to carry this place, and this community, with you.\n\nBy that, I mean that I hope you will remember what it felt like to be here, in this place, with these people, through joy and sorrow, triumph and heartbreak, and that you will carry that feeling with you.\n\nRyan addresses the graduates, urging them to carry with them the feeling of being \"in this place, with these people, through joy and sorrow, triumph and heartbreak.\" (Photo by Lathan Goumas, University Communications)\n\nCarry with you what it felt like to be surrounded by a group of fellow students who were as compassionate as they were talented.\n\nCarry with you what it felt like to learn from professors who loved a subject so much you couldn’t help but get excited about it, too.\n\nCarry with you what it felt like to live with some of the best friends you have ever made, who will walk alongside you for the rest of your lives.\n\nCarry with you the lessons you have learned here – lessons about building bridges, about getting to know people who are different from you, about remaining curious, and about doing the right thing, even when it’s hard and even when no one is watching.\n\nCarry with you how it felt to serve others and to devote your time and energy to something bigger than yourself.\n\nCarry with you UVA’s mission of citizen leadership and of public service, and carry what it felt like to lead selflessly and with integrity.\n\nCarry with you how it felt to be part of an incomparably strong community.\n\nCarry with you what it felt like to live in a community of trust and continue to live your life with honor.\n\nFor some, carry with you what it felt like to streak the Lawn, but please don’t make it a habit.\n\nAnd, finally, carry with you the memory of this day, of what it felt like to walk the Lawn, knowing, above all else, that you can do hard things, because you have already done hard things.\n\nIf you remember all of this, I have no doubt that you will carry the very best of this place with you as you face, with courage and purpose, the beautiful, joyous, challenging, sometimes tragic, and inevitably surprising road ahead. And should that road ever lead you back to Charlottesville, as I hope and trust it will, please know that we will leave the lights on for you.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2025, and good luck.",

    "content": "To the UVA community:\n\nI am writing to share materials related to the external review of the shooting that took place on UVA Grounds on Nov. 13, 2022, including two reports stemming from those reviews, an executive summary of the reports, and a list of actions the University has taken to improve public safety following those events. The executive summary fully describes the focus of each of the reports, as well as the process that went into their development and release. The remainder of this email provides a brief summary and a few key points.\n\nAs many members of our community remember firsthand, we experienced a devastating tragedy on Nov. 13, 2022, when a gunman opened fire on a group of UVA students returning from a class trip, taking the lives of Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr., and D’Sean Perry, wounding Mike Hollins and Marlee Morgan, and forever altering the lives of countless others.\n\nAs we grieved the terrible losses suffered that night, we also began the process of seeking to understand the events and circumstances surrounding it. The University’s Board of Visitors and I asked the attorney general of Virginia to appoint outside counsel to conduct an independent review of the University’s actions and to make recommendations for improvements to our public safety policies and practices.\n\nThe attorney general appointed two law firms to conduct the review. These firms delivered preliminary reports to the University in October of 2023. Our initial intention was to release them fairly quickly; however, after consulting with Albemarle County Commonwealth’s Attorney Jim Hingeley, we made the difficult decision to delay the release so as not to interfere with the criminal proceedings.\n\nNow that Christopher Jones has pled guilty and his sentencing has been delayed until late 2025, Mr. Hingeley has withdrawn his concern. Accordingly, after sharing the reports with the families of those who were killed and the individuals who were injured that night, and giving them a chance for review, we are now ready to release the final redacted reports. We are also providing a list of actions we have taken since the shooting to strengthen our efforts to identify and respond to threats to public safety.\n\nA note about the redactions: Universities are prohibited by federal law from disclosing student records, which is a broad category that encompasses many different types of information institutions keep about their students. The reports are redacted to protect that information from disclosure, which means significant portions of the reports themselves are inaccessible. There are also limited redactions to protect information that could impact safety and security operations. I recognize that the necessary redactions in these reports will likely make reading them a frustrating process, but we are bound by law. Federal law does permit institutions to request that individuals waive their right to keep certain information redacted. Unfortunately, despite our request, the University did not receive such a waiver from Christopher Jones, the convicted shooter. Our hope is that the accompanying executive summary will help in navigating the contents of the reports.\n\nAs president, my most important responsibility is the safety of every individual in our community and ensuring that we have the processes in place to provide for that protection. Although no one could have reasonably predicted, as the report concludes, that this violent act would occur, the report does identify areas where we can strengthen our threat assessment protocols – and in many cases, we have already done so.\n\nAs I mentioned, the materials we are releasing today include a full breakdown of the steps we have taken since November 2022, including:\n\nAugmenting the University’s threat-assessment function, including hiring new full-time personnel in key areas\n\nIncluding additional representatives from the University Police Division and Housing & Residence Life on UVA’s Threat Assessment Team\n\nUpdating training and guidance for non-law enforcement personnel on how to respond to reports of a firearm in a University residence hall\n\nEnhancing the student Care and Support Services team and realigning it within Student Health and Wellness to enable more effective triage and response to student concerns, including making referrals to the Threat Assessment Team when necessary\n\nAdvocating for legislation that would make it illegal to carry firearms on Virginia college campuses\n\nAlthough I hope this update brings a measure of solace, I know that this information will not provide answers to all of your questions, nor does it answer all of mine. It doesn’t ease the pain of losing beloved members of our community, and it doesn’t lessen the grief felt so deeply by the victims’ family and friends. It doesn’t undo the pain and trauma of those who were injured, of those who witnessed the shooting, and of those who continue to grapple with all that has happened. I can promise that we will continue to honor and remember Devin, Lavel, and D’Sean, whose lives and legacies will never be forgotten at UVA. We will continue to support the members of our community who were most directly affected by these events. And we will do everything within our power to promote the safety of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors.\n\nThanks to all of you for your patience, and to those who have worked tirelessly to make our community safer and stronger since the tragic events of Nov. 13, 2022.\n\nBest,\n\nJim",

    "content": "Dear Students and Colleagues,\n\nToday, we welcomed nearly 8,500 graduates to the Temple alumni family when we celebrated the Class of 2025 during the 138th university-wide commencement ceremony. It was a beautiful celebration for our graduates, their families and the entire Temple community, and I thank everyone who was able to join us.\n\nUnfortunately, I am disheartened to share that over the last several days, there have been a number of deeply disturbing incidents related to the conduct of some of our students. As you know, a disgraceful incident of antisemitism occurred at an off-campus establishment over the weekend, resulting in one student immediately being placed on interim suspension. Since then, our Division of Student Affairs has been continuing its investigation, and we have identified another student who has also been placed on interim suspension.\n\nYesterday, we became aware that a student participated in an interview with a media personality who has a history of producing extreme antisemitic and racist content. The content of this interview was both appalling and deeply offensive. Antisemitism is not tolerated at Temple. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms, and we will be relentless in efforts to combat it, especially when members of our community have been targeted because of their Jewish identity.\n\nUnrelated to this incident, we also recently learned of a troubling video circulating on social media in which a current Temple University student makes alarming comments related to the United States. The person is identified in this video as a member of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). SJP is not a recognized student organization at Temple and remains suspended because of actions that violated the Student Conduct Code. This suspension applies to all operations related to SJP using Temple’s name, branding or resources.\n\nWhile Temple is committed to honoring the principles of free speech and fostering an environment open to a diversity of thought, opinion and peaceful expression, the language and views expressed in these instances are reprehensible and not in keeping with our university’s values.\n\nAs we have advised before, the university’s Student Conduct Code applies to conduct on and off campus. The Division of Student Affairs is conducting thorough investigations into all of these incidents. Students who are found to be in violation of the Student Conduct Code will face disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion.\n\nThese events are concerning for our community. We have many resources available to support students, faculty and staff, and I encourage you to take advantage of them.\n\nThis is a time of celebration for our students and community. As we come together over the next few days to applaud the accomplishments of our graduating students, let us remember to stand strong with the entire Temple University family against all forms of ignorance and hate.\n\nI thank our students, faculty and staff for their continued dedication to Temple's mission and ensuring that the end of the semester is focused on what matters most: celebrating our graduates and wishing them success.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Students and Colleagues,\n\nAt approximately 3 p.m., the university became aware of reports that Temple students were involved in an antisemitic incident at an off-campus location last night. This is deeply disturbing, and it is with profound regret that I must share this news with our community.\n\nIn the strongest terms possible, let me be clear: antisemitism is abhorrent. It has no place at Temple and acts of hatred and discrimination against any person or persons are not tolerated at this university.\n\nOur Division of Student Affairs is conducting an investigation related to last night’s incident, and they have identified one Temple student who is believed to have been involved. This individual has already been placed on interim suspension.\n\nAny additional students who are found to be involved will face strict disciplinary action under the Student Conduct Code, up to and including expulsion. Anyone with additional information related to the reported events should contact the Dean of Students at dos@temple.edu.\n\nDisturbing incidents like this can impact members of the Temple community in many ways. Students can seek out support and guidance through Tuttleman Counseling Services and IDEAL’s Interfaith Inclusion Center. For faculty and staff, our Employee Assistance Program is available 24/7.\n\nI also encourage any member of the Temple community who has experienced discrimination or harassment to submit a report through the Department of Public Safety, the Equal Opportunity Compliance Office and the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. This can also be done through the Ethics and Compliance Helpline.\n\nI know that incidents like this do not represent our community and its values. Thank you for your support and continued commitment to ensuring that Temple provides a safe and welcoming environment to all its students, faculty, staff and neighbors.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident",

    "content": "To the Temple Community,\n\nWe know this is an exciting time for students, as the semester is winding down and next week’s Commencement ceremonies are on the horizon. For many students, this may be the last weekend that they will spend on campus this spring.\n\nThis year, Temple students have been great representatives of the Good Neighbor Initiative, and we know that will continue to be the case this weekend. We want students to enjoy themselves and have fun, but it is important that it is done in a responsible and respectful manner. We encourage all students to keep themselves apprised of the guidelines outlined within the Good Neighbor Initiative.\n\nJust as President Fry outlined last week, there will again be an enhanced public safety presence on and around Temple’s campus beginning tonight and through the weekend. We are taking proactive steps to ensure our students, employees and neighbors feel safe while on campus. Should an issue arise, Temple’s Department of Public Safety (TUDPS) and the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) will be ready.\n\nThis enhanced public safety presence, which was in place last week and has been coordinated alongside the PPD and SEPTA Transit Police, will see the university deploying a unified response team that includes police commanders, detectives, patrol officers and specialized units. This robust team will be in place through this weekend as we work to prevent the juvenile meetups that have had a negative impact on so many members of the Temple and North Philadelphia communities.\n\nStudents, faculty and staff members are encouraged to pay close attention to the TUalert system over the weekend, as it will be used to warn Temple community members of any immediate danger. Anyone who notices suspicious activity should also report it immediately to TUDPS by calling 215-204-1234 or utilizing the TUSafe app.\n\nThank you to everyone for their support and cooperation, and we wish the entire Temple community well as the semester draws to a close.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Griffin\n\nVice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police\n\nJodi Bailey Accavallo\n\nVice President for Student Affairs",

    "content": "Dear Students and Colleagues,\n\nEarlier this week, I had a conversation with Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel related to the large gatherings of juveniles that recently occurred near Temple University’s campus. Commissioner Bethel and other leaders from the City of Philadelphia recognize the importance of addressing this issue swiftly and effectively, as these meetups have negatively impacted both the Temple and North Philadelphia communities.\n\nThis will be an ongoing dialogue with Commissioner Bethel over the next several months. In particular, we will be diligent in exploring all solutions that help prevent situations like this from affecting our campus operations and disrupting and threatening our students, employees and neighbors.\n\nIn relation to last week’s incidents, I want to thank Temple’s Department of Public Safety (TUDPS), which has already identified several individuals involved in the assaults and robbery and is working tirelessly to hold them accountable. I also want to thank our Temple police officers, the School District of Philadelphia’s school safety officers, Pennsylvania Probation and Parole, TUDPS and Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) detectives, community members, and parents for their efforts in this investigation, as their collaboration has been instrumental in moving these cases forward.\n\nWhile we will continue to work with our partners in the City of Philadelphia to explore long-term interventions related to these challenges, we are taking immediate steps to ensure our community is safe. Unfortunately, we have become aware of social media posts that are encouraging another juvenile gathering near campus this weekend. Beginning tonight, there will be an enhanced public safety presence on and around Temple’s campus throughout the weekend. TUDPS is working, in close coordination with PPD and SEPTA Transit Police, to deploy a robust, unified response team that includes police commanders, detectives, patrol officers and specialized units.\n\nIn addition to collaborating with our partners in law enforcement, we have engaged faith-based, community and civic leaders in North Philadelphia, who share in our deep commitment to the safety and the well-being of our neighborhoods. One of our partners, Taylor Made Opportunities, will be on-site this weekend and throughout the summer months with their Corner to Connections program helping us to redirect teens to positive activities, resources and services.\n\nPlease pay close attention to any alerts or directions from TUDPS or TUalert. These notifications are issued to increase your safety and to allow officers to effectively respond to an incident or potential threat. Please continue to report any suspicious activity to TUDPS by calling 215-204-1234 or utilizing the TUSafe app. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and continued support as we work through these complex challenges.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nWe are thrilled to share that two distinguished faculty members of Temple University’s Center for the Performing and Cinematic Arts—Rea Tajiri, professor of film and media arts, and Professor Emerita of Dance Merián Soto—have been named 2025 Guggenheim Fellows by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Please join us in congratulating them on this remarkable accomplishment.\n\nNow in its 100th year, the Guggenheim Fellowship honors individuals who demonstrate exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or creative pursuit. For 2025, 198 outstanding artists and scholars across 53 fields were selected from among thousands of applicants through a rigorous peer-review process. Each fellow receives a monetary stipend to support independent work “under the freest possible conditions.”\n\nAt Temple, our faculty are at the heart of who we are as a community. Celebrating their scholarly achievements and creative endeavors shines a light on our mission. This year’s honorees reflect the drive and dedication that define our university.\n\nRea Tajiri, an award-winning interdisciplinary artist and educator, will use her fellowship to produce a film titled Non-Alien. The project explores the little-known history of Japanese American resettlement in major U.S. cities following World War II—drawing inspiration from her family history, including her father’s relocation to Chicago as part of the government-sponsored program.\n\nMerián Soto, an acclaimed dancer, choreographer, video artist and filmmaker, will use her fellowship to support a series of legacy projects that span her five-decade career. These include bringing her meditative Branch Dance to her native Puerto Rico.\n\nWe are proud to see Professors Tajiri and Soto recognized among this year’s Guggenheim Fellows. Their visionary work exemplifies the innovation, insight and impact that Temple faculty bring to the world. Read more about Professors Tajiri and Soto in this Temple Now article.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident\n\nGregory Mandel\n\nSenior Vice President and Provost\n\nRobert Stroker\n\nVice Provost for the Arts\n\nDean, Boyer College of Music and Dance and School of Theater, Film and Media Arts",

    "content": "Dear Students and Colleagues,\n\nOn both Saturday and Sunday evenings, the university sent the Temple community TUalerts about large groups of juveniles gathered on public streets and sidewalks near Temple University’s campus. While these gatherings were initially orderly, some of those present later became unruly, negatively impacting the Temple and North Philadelphia communities. I write to you today with deep concern and a firm commitment to address these troubling events, in partnership with the City of Philadelphia.\n\nOn Saturday, two Temple students were assaulted and ultimately required medical attention. A third and fourth student reported being pushed to the ground but did not require medical attention. On Sunday, one additional student was pushed to the ground and robbed but did not require medical treatment. Two other assaults were also reported that did not involve members of the Temple community. Multiple arrests were made across the two days, including seven on Sunday.\n\nOur Division of Student Affairs has been working with the affected students to make sure they are supported and have access to the appropriate resources following these incidents. We are grateful that their injuries were not more serious, but we are fully aware of the trauma and anxiety these acts have caused. We encourage any student who needs assistance to contact our Division of Student Affairs or Tuttleman Counseling Services.\n\nIn some cases, our Department of Public Safety receives advance notice of juvenile meetups, through either social media or law enforcement intelligence. Although that was not the case this weekend, but because we knew that many local K–12 schools were on spring break, the Department of Public Safety and the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) had deployed additional officers and resources to the area. Police worked diligently and effectively to disperse the crowd, preventing further injury to bystanders. We are incredibly thankful for their efforts.\n\nOur Department of Public Safety is thoroughly investigating these incidents, along with PPD investigators, using video from university, city and SEPTA cameras. We are also using social media in an attempt to identify these individuals. We are working tirelessly to identify those responsible and hold them accountable.\n\nIncidents like these are deeply unsettling and completely unacceptable to both the university community and our neighbors. We cannot allow this type of behavior to become normalized in the area surrounding our campus.\n\nVice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police Jennifer Griffin has been in contact with several key leaders at the PPD, and I will be speaking with Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel this evening. It is imperative that we work together to identify interventions that will prevent future situations like this.\n\nOur priority is and will continue to be the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff. You all expect and deserve a secure environment in which to live, work and learn, and we will continue to do everything we can to deliver just that. I will be sure to keep you apprised moving forward.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident",

    "content": "To the Temple community,\n\nEarlier this evening, at approximately 7 p.m., Police Officers from Temple University’s Department of Public Safety (TUDPS) were on-site as a large group of unsupervised juveniles gathered around Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue. Given past juvenile gatherings in the area and the fact that this week is spring break for many local K–12 schools, TUDPS and Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) deployed additional teams of police officers and supervisors to supplement the on-duty shift.\n\nWhile the group was initially orderly, this changed throughout the course of the evening. When some in the group became disorderly, a TUDPS supervisor contacted PPD to send additional resources to disperse the group. Unfortunately, one Temple student was assaulted near Temple Towers and another student was assaulted in the area of 12th and Montgomery Streets. At this time, their injuries are being evaluated. Additionally, a third student reported being pushed to the ground but did not require medical attention. TUDPS has been in contact with these students, and the Division of Student Affairs will continue to support them in every way possible.\n\nArrests were made throughout the evening as the crowd became disorderly, however, the assailants related to the assaults have not yet been identified. TUDPS will continue to investigate these incidents to identify those responsible. Anyone with information related to these crimes is urged to contact PPD Central Detectives at 215-686-3093 or the PPD TIP Line 215-686-TIPS (8477).\n\nIncidents like tonight’s are unacceptable. While we had no advance warning of tonight’s gathering, TUDPS has been in regular contact with PPD regarding planned and unannounced juvenile gatherings. These gatherings typically take place on public property, but their impact negatively affects our Temple community. We will continue to work with the city and PPD to address these incidents.\n\nWe encourage students to continuously familiarize themselves with the university’s available safety resources, like the walking escort program and Flight. More safety resources can be found at safety.temple.edu. Students can also call Temple Police any time by dialing 215-204-1234.\n\nStudents who are impacted are encouraged to seek support through Tuttleman Counseling Services, located at 1700 N. Broad Street. For information, call 215-204-7276 or visit the Tuttleman Counseling Services website. For faculty and staff members, our employee assistance program offers support and resources 24/7 online or call 1-888-267-8126.\n\nWe are thankful for the efforts of Temple, Philadelphia and SEPTA Police Officers, who worked together to disperse the crowd tonight and who will continue to patrol throughout the evening.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Griffin\n\nVice President for Public Safety\n\nJodi Bailey Accavallo\n\nVice President for Student Affairs",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nIt is with great appreciation and a bit of sadness that I write to share that after more than 30 years of dedicated service to Temple University, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Ken Kaiser, FOX ’89, ’94, ’03, has decided to retire at the end of this fiscal year. His last day will be June 30, 2025.\n\nAs some of you may know, Ken suffered a significant health event earlier this year and was out on medical leave for a period of time before returning to work. After deep reflection, he has decided to prioritize both his health and family. While I know this was a difficult decision for Ken, I support him wholeheartedly, and I am happy that he can now enjoy a well-deserved retirement with family and friends.\n\nAt the same time, however, the significance of Ken’s departure cannot be overstated. Ken has devoted his professional life to this university and in times of challenge, he’s been a constant—a calming force in any storm. His knowledge, leadership and genuine love for this institution have helped Temple thrive and grow, as he always made decisions with the best interests of the university and our students in mind. I know I speak for the entire Temple community when I say that we are profoundly grateful for his service.\n\nSince joining the university in 1991, Ken has held a variety of roles, including university privacy officer, director of finance and administration for Ambler and then for institutional advancement, senior associate vice president for finance and human resources, treasurer, chief financial officer and his current role of SVP and COO.\n\nBefore I arrived at Temple, I knew Ken was a respected Philadelphia higher education leader, as his reputation preceded him. In our time working together, he has lived up to every expectation and then some as a trusted colleague and advisor.\n\nIt was under Ken’s watch that the university began to undergo a significant physical transformation, as he led multiple campus master plans including Temple 2020 (2009) and Visualize Temple (2014) which resulted in developments like the Science Education and Research Center, Charles Library and the Temple Sports Complex. These plans provide a strong foundation as we consider the next iteration of our broader campus planning which Ken has been leading.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Ken provided steady leadership, as teams across the university regularly looked to him for guidance. He also played a key role in the evolution of the relationship between the university and Temple Health. Ken has always been a deliberate and thoughtful steward of university resources, which gained him the respect of colleagues around the university.\n\nThe most important illustration of Ken’s impact here at Temple is not only through what he accomplished as an administrator but rather the way in which he empowered his team. If you talk to just about anyone who has ever worked for Ken, you will find that he is universally loved. He has consistently put his employees in a position to succeed, but more importantly, he then gave them the space to do it. Ken saw the potential in everyone he worked with, and he trusted them to see projects through to fruition.\n\nAs Temple’s COO, Ken oversaw a portfolio that included budget, human resources, bursar, risk management and insurance, controller operations, treasury and investments, construction, facilities and operations, purchasing, real estate, environmental health and safety, sustainability, public safety, business services and auxiliaries. His departure leaves a big role to fill, but I know his team is well equipped for the task, in large part due to the knowledge and trust that Ken instilled in them.\n\nWe will soon launch a national search for Ken’s replacement. In the meantime, I have asked David Marino, vice president of finance and treasurer, to serve as interim COO upon Ken’s departure.\n\nOnce again, I want to personally thank Ken for his service to Temple University over the last three decades. He will be deeply missed. Please join me in wishing him well in retirement.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear students, faculty and staff,\n\nWe are entering a traditionally joyful season in the academic year—the time when we celebrate more than 15,000 graduates across the University of Minnesota; the occasion to look back with pride on all we have accomplished over this semester; and look ahead with anticipation for what comes next.\n\nThis year I will join you in exuberant cheers for our graduates. I will also be reflecting on the profound contribution to society embodied in these smiling faces. I will think about the discoveries that flow from this University, the additions to human knowledge, and the improvements to lives across Minnesota, our nation and around the world.\n\nThis is why we are focused on our mission—our students, faculty and staff.\n\nUniversities across the nation face unprecedented challenges. The challenges pose risk to academic freedom, to research and educational funding, and to members of their communities. University of Minnesota researchers have received more than 70 stop-work orders on federal grants. We face investigations. Our international students have had visas revoked (thankfully, some of those actions since reversed), and one was detained.\n\nIn the face of all that, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the University of Minnesota’s mission and values—our students, faculty and staff. Those who know me well, know that I would rather take action than make statements. So I want to offer you a few quick updates on what the University is doing to preserve our mission and advance our work.\n\nAs I write this, I am just returning from a meeting of presidents in the Association of American Universities, where we worked together to strengthen our collective advocacy with legislators and policymakers. The AAU has also led legal actions, which we have joined, to preserve our shared mission, and we stand ready to take that course again, where necessary. The week after next, I’ll be meeting with presidents in the Big Ten Academic Alliance to discuss how we can harness the collective power of these amazing institutions.\n\nAn effective response requires all of us working together—and not just all of us presidents. In recent weeks, I’ve met with groups across our University—from our undergraduate student government leaders to some of our most senior faculty, to leaders of our Muslim, Jewish, LGBTQIA+, and so many other communities, drawing ideas from the broad spectrum of voices that make this University truly excellent and inform our actions.\n\nTo assist our researchers, we are establishing a new fund to help replace resources suddenly stopped by the federal government and allow them to continue pursuing life-changing discoveries. You’ll hear more about that later this week from our Vice President for Research and Innovation, Shashank Priya.\n\nTo protect and support members of our international community, we’ve expanded our Student Legal Services, ensuring that international students from all of our campuses have access to legal representation when they need it.\n\nImportantly, even as we adapt to changing conditions with new initiatives, we continue to uphold long-standing commitments that support a diverse, inclusive campus environment where all our students can thrive, and to conduct research that will advance the state, nation and world, whether or not they subject us to criticism and scrutiny. We will not take unilateral action that undermines our mission or values.\n\nAcross the University, the goal is not just to hang on, but to provide leadership at a time of challenge and uncertainty in so many areas of society. In that spirit, our Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy is launching the Vaccine Integrity Project, which will help fill a void that has developed in investigating the safety and effectiveness of potential new vaccines.\n\nAll of this recalls for me a quote I’ve cited before, from one of my favorite books, “Finding the Mother Tree:” “Every single tree in the forest is connected underground, forming a vast network of communication and mutual support.” In the vast forest that is the University of Minnesota, we share that kind of community—it is both a source of inspiration and a call to action for all of us, to care for and support one another.\n\nI hope that even in difficult times—perhaps especially in difficult times—you share that pride in our community. And as we approach the end of the semester, I want you to know you have my gratitude for your part in this community, together with my admiration and my congratulations for all you have accomplished. I wish you joyous celebrations.\n\nWith appreciation,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear students, faculty and staff,\n\nOver these past several weeks, I have engaged with members of our University of Minnesota community, many of whom openly expressed their hopes, but also concerns and frustrations on a wide range of issues—including ways to create a more welcoming environment.\n\nYou made it abundantly clear that you want more than words from University leadership. You want decisive action—especially when it comes to how the University will address and prevent bias and intimidation against members of our community.\n\nWe hear you. We agree. Harassment on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity and sexual orientation, disability or citizenship status will not be tolerated on our campuses.\n\nToday, I want to outline specific steps the University of Minnesota is taking to reject any and all forms of hatred directed toward members of our Jewish communities, regardless of their political beliefs. To advance this priority, the University will implement the following initiatives:\n\na mandatory module on antisemitism for all instructors as part of the University’s inclusive teaching and prevention training\n\nfor all instructors as part of the University’s inclusive teaching and prevention training inclusion of specific antisemitism questions in the 2026 Campus Climate Survey (in addition to questions about the experiences of all students, faculty and staff)\n\nin the 2026 Campus Climate Survey (in addition to questions about the experiences of all students, faculty and staff) and the creation of a dedicated Jewish Alumni Network\n\nSimilar efforts are also underway to address bias and hate targeting any group based on shared ancestry, ethnicity or protected identities. This includes a mandatory module on Islamophobia.\n\nCombating antisemitism—as with any form of hate—requires sustained commitment, evaluation and growth, and it demands meaningful collaboration. In recent weeks, my leadership team and I gained invaluable insights from our partners at Minnesota Hillel, the Hillel International Campus Climate Initiative and Chabad. We connected with members of our local Jewish communities to learn more about their perspectives and experiences.\n\nWe are also meeting with students and faculty across a spectrum of ideologies. We understand there are many views across our community, but we can all agree there is no place for antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of hatred on our campuses. My leadership team and I are committed to cultivating relationships with a vibrant and pluralistic community.\n\nMore information about some of the ways the University is supporting the safety and wellbeing of Jewish students and scholars is available. Importantly, leadership is developing additional webpages—one focused on combating Islamophobia and another addressing discrimination and discriminatory harassment that may affect members of our community. Information about these new webpages will be shared broadly once they are complete.\n\nI would also encourage you to visit our Office of Student Affairs’ website to review the University’s Guiding Principles of the Student Conduct Code.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived at the University of Minnesota last spring, my top priority has been to build a community where all students, faculty and staff can feel safe and thrive.\n\nThere is much more work ahead, but please know that our entire leadership team remains committed to deep listening, honest reflection and—most importantly—taking action.\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

We are actively working to gather more details about this incident.\n\nIn cases like this, the University takes steps to ensure students are connected to internal resources and support, such as Student Legal Service and International Student and Scholar Services.\n\nThe University had no prior knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities before it occurred.\n\nIt is important to note that our campus departments of public safety, including UMPD, do not enforce federal immigration laws, and our officers do not inquire about an individual’s immigration status.

    "content": "“Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.”\n\nI gather wisdom from this proverb, which is quite relevant today as we navigate a rapidly changing environment that has divided and fractured parts of our state, nation and world.\n\nThese are indeed complex and uncertain times in higher education, where the value of our work, the autonomy to carry it out, and how it is funded are all part of the local and national dialogue.\n\nIt is important to remember that, as students, faculty and staff, we are stronger as a collective. And by finding common ground, the University of Minnesota will remain an educational beacon that bridges divides and paves the way to a brighter future.\n\nWhether you are a federally sponsored researcher facing a stop-work order, or a staff member supporting students with visa status concerns, we are dedicated to navigating these changes, all while maintaining an unwavering commitment to teaching, research and outreach.\n\nTo our students, faculty and staff who may feel undervalued, disrespected or voiceless, I want you to know you are not alone. Regardless of your race, gender identity, disability, citizenship status, sexual orientation, or political or religious beliefs, you belong here at the University of Minnesota. We are stronger, wiser and more effective in our mission with all of you.\n\nYou play an invaluable role in our community, and I am committed to ensuring you feel welcomed and protected. I hear your concerns, value your input and will continue to advocate for your freedoms, your safety and your wellbeing.\n\nActions speak louder than words. To that end, the University will continue to support and advocate for your rights to peaceful protest and the free expression of diverse viewpoints, as referenced on the civic responsibilities webpage. This University has a rich history and commitment to free expression that dates back 174 years, and so it is our shared responsibility to uphold these core values.\n\nThe University will take decisive action to end any and all forms of harassment, intimidation and bias against members of our community. Each of us must stand in firm opposition to harassment, intimidation and bias, and prevent their recurrence.\n\nWhen we improve our systems to reduce harassment and intimidation of any one group, it aids in the prevention and bias toward other groups. All boats rise when bias and intimidation are appropriately addressed. And it will take every single one of us, working together, to foster a healthy, supportive community that we can be proud of.\n\nWe are one of America’s leading public research universities, thanks in large part to how our schools, colleges and campuses have embraced students, faculty, staff and collaborators from all parts of the world. The University of Minnesota will not waver in its support of international students and scholars, who will continue to play a vital role in our success.\n\nFor our international students, faculty and staff who have questions about how the University will support them and their efforts, I would encourage you to visit our Rapid Response website for updated information. The weekly updates from our colleagues at International Student and Scholar Services also provide important resources.\n\nMy leadership team and I continue to loudly champion the critical role and value of our University—from St. Paul to Washington, D.C.—so that your voices are heard and your efforts are widely promoted. And we will continue to partner with higher education associations, like the Association of American Universities, to address the legality of federal directives that impact our powerful public service mission.\n\nHaving connected with students, faculty and staff in recent weeks, I stand with you amid the fear, uncertainty and anxiety. This is unfortunately a time when we all must learn to live with ambiguity as we maneuver these challenges together. I cannot promise to have all the answers, but I can commit to being transparent and actively engaging with our community on tough issues.\n\nWe are stronger as a collective. And we will emerge from this time of uncertainty across higher education better than before.\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Thank you, Chair Mayeron and members of the board.\n\nIt has been a busy past few weeks here at the University of Minnesota.\n\nAnd I have a number of systemwide updates that I would like to share with you today.\n\nI would like to begin my President’s Report by focusing on the rapidly changing landscape in Washington, D.C.\n\nMy leadership team and I continue to navigate the uncertainty surrounding recent federal communications and executive orders.\n\nFirst, let me reassure you that our values and mission remain unchanged.\n\nThe University of Minnesota has thrived for more than 170 years.\n\nWe will not waver in our commitment to training the next generation of leaders.\n\nAnd we will strive to continue generating the knowledge and innovations our society so desperately needs.\n\nIn accordance with our mission, we will serve our state, nation and world to the best of our ability.\n\nIt is important, though, for us to acknowledge that severe cuts to federal funding would have drastic implications that extend far beyond our campuses.\n\nThe University of Minnesota is the fifth-largest employer in our state.\n\nAnd we play an absolutely critical role in driving economic activity across all 87 counties.\n\nSlashes to federal funding would undoubtedly affect the overall economic health of local communities of all shapes and sizes across Minnesota.\n\nAs well as our ability to deliver on our mission.\n\nWe are working diligently to measure the short- and long-term impact of this new federal landscape.\n\nChancellors, deans and central unit leaders are developing contingency plans for how the University may respond should the federal government follow through on its proposed cuts and mandates.\n\nThis includes careful evaluation of our multiyear financial commitments.\n\nAt the same time, we will not overreact to what remains a very fluid situation.\n\nWe are doing everything in our power to minimize disruptions or distractions.\n\nFor our students, our faculty and our staff.\n\nWe are also engaging members of our University community in this process.\n\nKnowing that we are much more effective when we work together.\n\nThe University also is partnering with higher education associations to address the legality of federal directives that impact our mission.\n\nWe are also working diligently to address the stop-work orders placed on multiple federal grants.\n\nTo date, our University has received 15 terminations or full stop-work orders from federal agencies.\n\nAn additional 26 awards have been impacted by partial stop-work orders.\n\nThe University continues to look for opportunities to appeal these actions.\n\nWe are also assessing ways in which our University can support faculty and staff who are directly impacted by these orders.\n\nTo reiterate, the impact of these federal funding cuts would be significant.\n\nAs President, I am committed to ensuring our primary missions of teaching, research and outreach thrive.\n\nAnd I will continue to advocate on behalf of this amazing institution.\n\nAs the University explores every avenue to aggressively address the challenges posed by the recent federal communications and executive orders.\n\nI would now like to share some important leadership updates with you.\n\nFirst, I am pleased to announce that, following a nationwide search, the University has selected Ryan Schmiesing to serve as vice president for strategic initiatives.\n\nAnd I am appreciative of your support and approval of this hire.\n\nAs vice president for strategic initiatives, Ryan will play a primary role in advancing multiple cross-cutting initiatives that elevate our University’s shared mission and goals.\n\nThis includes supporting the Maroon, Gold and Bold systemwide strategic plan, in partnership with the steering committee and the broader University community.\n\nI am also excited to share that John Morris has been selected to serve as CEO and President of the University Foundation.\n\nJohn will join UMF on May 1.\n\nAs CEO and President, John will be responsible for leading the University’s development enterprise.\n\nAs well as ensuring oversight of the foundation’s two subsidiaries in real estate and investment management.\n\nHis work will leverage the foundation’s 45-member Board of Trustees and systemwide development community to ensure alignment with our Maroon, Gold and Bold strategic plan.\n\nI also would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Kathy Schmidlkofer for the tremendous leadership she has provided UMF over the past 11 years.\n\nChristine Kiel recently stepped into the role of Interim Director of Government and Community Relations.\n\nChristine, who served as our Director of State Relations for many years, has a wealth of experience and expertise in this space.\n\nHer leadership has ensured continuity in our advocacy efforts, which have been quite robust in recent weeks.\n\nSenior leaders from across the University have been very active at the State Capitol.\n\nAdvocating on behalf of our students, faculty and staff.\n\nAnd highlighting the many ways in which our University is positively impacting the state, nation and world.\n\nI myself have testified multiple times in St. Paul in recent weeks.\n\nSupport from the state not only ensures a successful future for our University.\n\nIt ensures a successful future for our state and nation.\n\nUnder Christine’s leadership, I am confident that our Government and Community Relations team will continue to thrive.\n\nI would also like to thank Melisa López Franzen for her leadership and dedication to the University.\n\nMelisa left the University last month to pursue other leadership opportunities, and we wish her the best.\n\nLastly, we are in the process of conducting a national search for our next Executive Vice President and Provost.\n\nRachel Croson will step down at the end of the academic year.\n\nThis position is critical to our public mission and strategic vision.\n\nRecruitment is actively underway.\n\nThe search committee will be interviewing candidates later this spring.\n\nI would like to wrap up my President’s Report by acknowledging the questions and concerns raised by members of our University community as it pertains to institutional statements and academic freedom.\n\nFirst, I would like to extend my appreciation to the Task Force on Institutional Speech.\n\nThe members of this task force put in countless hours of work—outside of their normal duties—to address the issue of unit statements or position statements on matters of public concern.\n\nRegardless of the outcome from today’s board discussion, please know I am committed to upholding individual academic freedom.\n\nWe know that universities across the country are facing numerous challenges related to academic freedom.\n\nI want to reiterate the core values that I have continued to express since I arrived here on campus last year.\n\nThe purpose of academic freedom is to ensure that our faculty and students can pursue the widest range of ideas and questions in their research and scholarship, teaching and learning, and campus dialogue.\n\nIt is essential to our core mission, as a University that produces new knowledge in service to our state, nation and world.\n\nAcademic freedom is the bedrock principle safeguarding open inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nHere at the University of Minnesota, critical inquiry and the pursuit of bold ideas have produced countless new discoveries and innovations that have improved lives.\n\nI will continue to advocate for and protect the academic freedom of our individual faculty, staff and students.\n\nPersonally, I am a public health researcher who previously directed multiple centers that were designed to share evidence-based knowledge on critical societal challenges.\n\nAnd so I fully appreciate the questions and concerns emanating from our University community.\n\nThank you for your time and attention.\n\nThat concludes my President’s Report.",

    "content": "Dear students, faculty and staff,\n\nAs President, there is no greater responsibility than to ensure each and every member of our community feels safe, valued and respected. Regardless of your race, gender identity, disability status, sexual orientation or religious beliefs, we are fully committed to ensuring that everyone feels welcomed and protected here at the University of Minnesota.\n\nI am writing to you today, as our Twin Cities campus is now the subject of two federal investigations involving allegations of antisemitism: a U.S. Department of Education investigation and a pending U.S. Department of Justice task force campus visit. We also received a failing score on the Anti-Defamation League’s latest campus antisemitism report card.\n\nDuring the first eight months of my presidency, I have been working closely with members of our University community to foster a safe, welcoming environment for everyone.\n\nUnfortunately, harassment, discrimination and bias — including antisemitism — continues to exist across the globe, negatively impacting people and communities. Here at the University of Minnesota, we take these issues very seriously.\n\nAs a leadership team and a University, we are strongly committed to enhancing support for members of our community who are Jewish. We are in regular communication with Jewish students and faculty groups, who have been advising us to better understand their lived experiences in this time, and augment their experience on campus.\n\nIn response to their advocacy, the University recently joined the Hillel Campus Climate Initiative — a nationwide program that equips campus administrators with strategies to counter antisemitism and foster an environment where Jewish students feel safe expressing their identities.\n\nOver the past year, the University has made substantial improvements to its Bias Response and Referral Network to ensure that reporting is easier, intuitive and effective. We have also worked to clarify and communicate our policies regarding time, place and manner for events, demonstrations and civic engagement.\n\nLet me be clear. Any and all forms of harassment, intimidation and bias against any member of our University community will not be tolerated. Decisive measures will be taken to end any hostile actions based on shared ancestry or any other protected characteristic, and University leaders will continue to work diligently to prevent their recurrence.\n\nThere is absolutely no place for antisemitism at the University of Minnesota. In accordance with our institutional values, we firmly and aggressively reject any and all forms of hatred directed toward members of our Jewish community.\n\nSince the Anti-Defamation League issued its report card, we have unfortunately learned the University did not provide updated information that informed our grade. We are actively working with the ADL to address this matter and clarify the many actions we have implemented over the past year to prevent and combat antisemitism, which were not reflected in their report card.\n\nThe allegations under investigation and scores on the ADL report card do not reflect our strong systemwide commitment and comprehensive, proactive approach to ensure that everyone feels safe. As we have said from the outset, the University will fully cooperate with any reviews or investigations involving these important matters.\n\nFor individuals who believe they have experienced any type of bias or discrimination, I strongly encourage you to report this activity to the University’s Bias Response and Referral Network. This network ensures that reported incidents are routed appropriately so that our teams can respond through the provision of supportive measures, investigation, educational coaching or other strategies.\n\nWe all play an essential role in cultivating a welcoming environment where everyone feels safe and valued. I encourage each and every member of our University community to stand in firm opposition to every form of harassment, intimidation and bias.\n\nWith your commitment, cooperation and support, the University of Minnesota will continue to be a place where inclusivity is celebrated, and where every individual is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

University leaders and I will provide you with updates as new details emerge.\n\nWe also encourage you to visit our Rapid Response website for the latest updates on a range of issues, including diversity, equity and inclusion; biomedical research funding; immigration; and information from and potential changes to the Department of Education.\n\nThank you, again, for the tremendous dedication and resilience that you continue to display during challenging times. I know that all members of our University community share my unwavering support for our land-grant mission and its extraordinary impact on countless lives across our state, nation and world.\n\nAs we move forward together, please know that we will continue to advocate on behalf of our amazing institution and its mission.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

Teams are working together to find solutions to some of society’s greatest challenges—from the highly pathogenic bird flu that is threatening wildlife to debilitating medical conditions that affect military veterans.\n\nHere at the University of Minnesota, the knowledge, discoveries and innovations that we generate every single day are not confined to our five campuses. They are translated in ways that benefit people and their communities. This is illustrated by the 25 new small businesses we launched last year based on University research, creating new jobs and driving economic growth.\n\nAs one of America’s leading public research universities, we remain steadfast in our commitment to improving the health, safety and prosperity of all Minnesotans.\n\nThe University of Minnesota and Essentia Health are working together to chart a bold, new solution for the future of healthcare in our state. This new, not-for-profit healthcare entity combines our people, systems, capabilities and expertise so that we can deliver a new level of seamless, expanded healthcare across Minnesota.\n\nThis is merely a snapshot of the many great things happening across the University of Minnesota System.\n\nWe now have an opportunity to build on our momentum as we work together to reimagine the future of this great institution. And so as we embark on systemwide strategic planning, engaging with countless individuals across the University and beyond, I look forward to partnering with our community so that we can create a roadmap that honors our past, while boldly defining our future.\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident\n\nA closer look at a startup powerhouse\n\nU of M is a national leader when it comes to startup creation, progressively ranking among the top four universities in the country. In this video, learn more about how innovations in areas like health and sustainability are turning visionary research into real-world impact.\n\nContinuing to make Black history at U of M\n\nLives and identities are shaped by decades and centuries. They can be forever altered in minutes or seconds. For the individuals and communities who continue to make Black history at U of M and beyond, change starts wherever the powers of creativity, vision and joy meet.\n\nMaroon and gold at the Capitol\n\nThe State Capitol was a spirited sea of maroon and gold on February 18, as students, faculty, staff and alumni representing all five system campuses advocated on behalf of the University’s legislative requests at U of M Day at the Capitol.\n\nTracking bird flu’s threat to Minnesota wildlife\n\nResearchers from the College of Veterinary Medicine are leading a collaborative effort to address highly pathogenic avian influenza (also known as bird flu) and its emerging threat to Minnesota wildlife.",

Pending approval from the Board of Regents, which will meet March 14, Ryan will join the University on March 31.\n\nAs vice president for strategic initiatives, Ryan will play a primary role in advancing multiple cross-cutting initiatives that elevate the University’s shared mission and goals. This includes supporting the Maroon, Gold and Bold systemwide strategic plan, in partnership with the steering committee and the broader University community.\n\nHe also will collaborate and coordinate with senior leaders and stakeholders in shared governance, along with academic and administrative units, to identify and advance key systemwide priorities. Ryan will report directly to me and will serve as part of the University’s senior leadership team.\n\nRyan brings a wealth of experience to Minnesota, having spent the past three decades serving in leadership roles at the Ohio State University and in government. Ryan most recently served as senior vice provost of external engagement, where he led the design and implementation of external engagement strategies that connect Ohio State expertise, scholarship and service to local, statewide, national and international communities. At Ohio State, Ryan also provided leadership of regional campus strategy and operations, in close collaboration with its deans and directors.\n\nBased on the vast knowledge Ryan has acquired while working for a fellow Big Ten institution, I am confident he will excel in this new leadership role. Please join me in welcoming Ryan to the University of Minnesota community.\n\nI also would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the search committee co-chairs—Vice President Shashank Priya and Dean Jamie Prenkert—and the entire search committee for their tremendous support, collaboration and service.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

As Executive Director of Government and Community Relations, Melisa led lobbying and advocacy efforts on behalf of the University of Minnesota System—at the State Capitol, in Washington, D.C., and across Minnesota—ensuring the distinct value of our five campuses and countless other statewide locations was recognized and reinforced.\n\nDuring her time at the University, Melisa has substantially strengthened our Government and Community Relations team, assembling a group of expert individuals with a wealth of experience and relationships. They are passionate and dedicated to sharing the tremendous impact our University has on the state, nation and world with elected leaders, policymakers and other stakeholders. Under Melisa’s leadership, the team has expanded and strengthened our relationships at the local, state and federal level, advancing our mission as a leading public research institution and one of Minnesota’s most important assets.\n\nI am so very grateful for Melisa’s leadership and dedication to the University’s mission and strategic objectives. Please join me in thanking Melisa for her many contributions and wishing her the best in her future endeavors.\n\nAs we transition, I am excited to announce that Christine Kiel will serve as interim leader of Government and Community Relations, effective February 24.\n\nChristine, who currently serves as Director of State Relations, brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this interim role. Her leadership will ensure continuity in our advocacy efforts, and I am confident that our Government and Community Relations team will only continue to thrive.\n\nI look forward to working with and supporting this team so they can further implement a detailed plan to strengthen relationships with elected leaders, advocate strongly for systemwide needs, and navigate federal guidance and local government issues.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear students, faculty and staff,\n\nLast month, the University of Minnesota and Essentia Health came together to announce a bold, new path forward for the future of healthcare in our state.\n\nThis newly proposed vision has been well received across Minnesota. I also recognize our announcement generated important questions around how this new vision would affect patients, providers and our University.\n\nToday, I am writing to provide updates on our shared vision for an integrated health model — one that reinvests in research and education, rural healthcare and increases access to essential healthcare services across Minnesota.\n\nLeaders from across the University and Essentia continue to engage in productive conversations toward helping Minnesota overcome its most pressing healthcare challenges, while identifying opportunities to best serve the needs of patients and providers across our state.\n\nAbove all else, this vision prioritizes patients and providers. In fact, it is intentionally designed to sustain existing patient and caregiver relationships, making it easier for patients and providers to reduce logistical hurdles, increase access and innovation, and effectively allocate resources to improve health in one of the most geographically expansive healthcare entities in the state.\n\nBut why now?\n\nLike other states across the country, Minnesota faces critical healthcare challenges. The Governor’s Task Force convened last year, and input from stakeholders across the state all point toward the need for a bold new path forward — the status quo is not sustainable for healthcare in our state or our system. As one of America’s leading public research universities, it is our duty to find solutions to the greatest challenges surrounding health and healthcare delivery.\n\nThere is urgency for us to forge a new path forward. The University’s existing agreements with Fairview Health Services expire at the end of 2026. The status quo of our partnership is no longer possible, and the state and our patients need a path forward in which the Medical School can thrive in its land-grant mission.\n\nWe have been striving to be in constructive conversation with Fairview, our longtime partner. While you likely heard the news that Fairview has stated it is not interested in extending its existing relationship, the University and Essentia continue to believe there is opportunity to build a bold, shared solution for Minnesota healthcare that best meets the needs of patients and our state.\n\nWe believe the time is now for a new model that will provide more comprehensive care delivered closer to home, where patients need it the most — especially in rural and Tribal communities that have fewer local healthcare options. We owe it to our patients, physicians and all of our caregivers to find a new solution. Our focus is on transformational change and our responsibilities to serve Minnesotans and their health — not a structure or contract focused on buildings and faceless transactions.\n\nWe will remain steadfast in our commitment to create a seamless system of care — one that maximizes the benefits of the University’s teaching, training and research to expand the reach of our service across Minnesota. This includes care, clinical trials, research innovation, and the necessary training of the physicians and other professional health professionals that all Minnesotans need.\n\nCentral to our shared vision: a bold course for the future in which the University continues to provide high-quality, accessible care for patients, while supporting health professionals across our organizations so they may do what they do best, care for patients.\n\nTo help answer your questions and provide more timely updates, I encourage you to visit our website for detailed information about this newly proposed vision for healthcare. The website also includes our latest proposal to Fairview.\n\nWe will provide more updates once they are available, but until then, thank you for all you do each day to build a brighter, healthier future for Minnesota.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nSince our founding in 1851, the University of Minnesota has distinguished itself as a global leader in research, scholarship and creative practice.\n\nFrom pioneering the first open heart surgery to unlocking the secrets of DNA repair, our students, faculty and staff have always maintained an unwavering commitment to serving the world through discovery and innovation.\n\nThank you for everything you do.\n\nThe federal government’s recent notice calling for a 15 percent indirect cost rate on all new awards from the National Institutes of Health is a direct attack on our ability to advance the University’s public service mission, and it has created fear and uncertainty across our community. This decision would cut reimbursements for research facilities and administrative costs, which cover critical, lifesaving research activities ranging from patient safety to research security. It would no doubt have serious consequences for patients across the state, as well as our students, faculty and staff.\n\nAccording to Mark Becker, President of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, “NIH slashing the reimbursement of research costs will slow and limit medical breakthroughs that cure cancer and address chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Let there be no mistake: this is a direct and massive cut to lifesaving medical research.”\n\nAs a principal investigator on numerous NIH grants throughout my career, I understand how devastating this announcement must be for many members of our community.\n\nUniversity leaders convened over the weekend to chart a path forward, and we are actively partnering with higher education associations and peer institutions across the country to identify ways in which we can effectively address this rapidly evolving situation head on. With guidance and support from our Government and Community Relations Team, we have implemented a broad outreach strategy to ensure that members of our federal and state delegation fully appreciate the profound implications of this notice.\n\nWe are also supporting national efforts led by higher education associations to address the legality of this directive, and the University will stand in firm opposition to such drastic cuts that impede on our ability to advance research discoveries and innovations.\n\nMy leadership team and I will remain fully engaged on this issue, as well as other federal policy changes that affect our community and impact our operations. I recognize that news of this notice creates a significant level of fear, uncertainty and concern.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to ensuring our University’s primary missions of teaching, research and outreach thrive. And I will continue to advocate on your behalf, as the University explores every avenue to aggressively address the challenges posed by this notice.\n\nWe are one of America’s leading public research universities, and I will loudly champion the work of our students, faculty and staff so they can continue to advance research, scholarship and creative practice for the betterment of our society.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding the latest announcement from NIH, please contact our Research and Innovation Office at [email protected], or connect with a research administrator in your school, college or unit. I also would encourage you to visit z.umn.edu/fed-impacts for research-related updates and FAQs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear students, faculty and staff,\n\nAs the federal government continues to propose new policy changes on issues ranging from diversity, equity and inclusion to immigration, I fully recognize that these developments have exacerbated uncertainty, concern and fear among some members of our University of Minnesota community. That is understandable given the rapid and regularly evolving changes emanating from Washington, D.C.\n\nAs President, I am writing to address any confusion and reaffirm my—and the University’s—longstanding commitment to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment that best supports the needs of each and every individual across our five campuses, regardless of their citizenship status.\n\nPublic research universities like ours play an essential role in supporting and advancing a society that is humane and just. Here at the University of Minnesota, diversity, equity and inclusion is ingrained in our values, and it advances and elevates our mission.\n\nI want to assure all students, faculty and staff that my leadership team and I truly value the activities that support diversity of thought and inclusion, which enhance our teaching and strengthen our research.\n\nTo further clarify, we have not rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Minnesota, and we are not making any preemptive changes to our existing programs.\n\nInstead, we are focusing on our commitment to current employees and programs that contribute to this important work. My leadership team and I felt it was the responsible decision to pause expanding our current activities and hiring new personnel until federal policies are further clarified.\n\nI also want to clarify the University’s position when it comes to international students and scholars.\n\nFirst and foremost, I care deeply about our international community. We are a global university, and our international students, faculty and staff are a core component of our identity and our excellence.\n\nInternational students and scholars have been—and always will be—an essential part of our University community. They, along with other employees and students who may be affected by newly proposed immigration policies, will continue to play a vital role in the success of Minnesota and our University well into the future. I am fully committed to their ongoing safety and success.\n\nPersonnel and resources are in place to support international students, faculty and staff who may be affected by these federal policy changes. I understand some members of our community have questions that are specific to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This webpage is a great resource for answers to frequently asked questions on this topic. Because this situation is rapidly evolving, our teams will continue to update the webpage to provide updated information and guidance.\n\nI want to reinforce that campus departments of public safety, including UMPD on the Twin Cities campus, do not have a role in enforcing federal civil immigration laws. Accordingly, our officers do not view it as their role to inquire about an individual’s immigration status. Their focus remains on public safety, fostering trust and maintaining strong relationships across the University community.\n\nAll of us recognize that colleges and universities nationwide are under heightened pressure and greater scrutiny. That said, the University of Minnesota will not waver in its commitment to fostering a welcoming environment for students, faculty and staff from all over the world. We will stay true to our strong public service mission to ensure we remain one of America’s leading public research universities.\n\nI have tasked a group of University leaders to monitor ongoing developments in Washington, D.C., and they are assessing how these decisions affect our community and operations. As has been our longstanding pledge, the University is fully committed to keeping all members of our community well informed so they can navigate this evolving, complex landscape.\n\nThank you for your support, your leadership and your collaboration as we move forward together as one University community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

From increasing costs, limited access and declining reimbursements to workforce shortages and structural inequities that amplify health disparities.\n\nMinnesotans have said loud and clear that healthcare needs to work better for them and their families. We hear you, and we agree.\n\nNegotiations over the letter of intent that we signed in good faith with Fairview leaders in February 2024 have not progressed in ways that I can assure you would meet the needs of our public service mission, so we are proposing a new path forward.\n\nThe University of Minnesota and Essentia Health are coming together to propose a solution that benefits all Minnesotans — a new, not-for-profit healthcare entity.\n\nOur goal is to infuse the very best of what our organizations have done for decades. Whether it’s providing world-class care to patients in rural, urban and Tribal communities, and everywhere in between. Training and delivering 70% of the state’s healthcare workforce. Or developing new innovations that lead to life-changing treatments.\n\nThis is just the start of many transparent and comprehensive discussions we will have, as we work collaboratively to envision a brighter future for healthcare in the communities we are so privileged to serve.\n\nI look forward to working alongside our students, faculty, staff and all those who provide care to our patients so that, together, we can meet the critical health needs of today, and long into the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident\n\nNews release: University of Minnesota and Essentia Health share bold new vision for healthcare in Minnesota",

    "content": "As we embark on an exciting new semester, I am thrilled to see the vibrancy restored across our five campuses, sparked by the arrival of so many new and returning students.\n\nI am now more than halfway through my first year as president, and so I am personally grateful to begin a new semester having familiarity with the people, places and traditions that make the University of Minnesota truly exceptional.\n\nA new semester provides an opportunity for us to come together, as friends and colleagues, and set ambitious personal and professional goals that may have otherwise seemed improbable. A new semester also provides an opportunity for us to step outside our comfort zones and embrace new challenges.\n\nTogether, we can capitalize on this moment by building on our tremendous momentum in Crookston, Duluth, Morris, Rochester, Minneapolis and St. Paul.\n\nEnrollment across our five campuses surpassed 70,000 for the first time ever. Our graduation rates reached historic highs. And Times Higher Education recently ranked us No. 1 in interdisciplinary science among all U.S. public universities, which is quite remarkable considering the greatest challenges impacting our society can only be solved by working across traditional academic siloes.\n\nWe have plenty of great stories to tell, which is why I am so excited about the relaunch of Brief. For 55 years, Brief has served as the primary hub for news and events that impact our University System. The newly enhanced Brief will help us project the University’s excellence, and the incredible possibilities for our collective future, with loud and unapologetic confidence.\n\nAs part of the relaunch of Brief, I also am delighted to introduce a new presidential blog so that I can communicate more directly with our community about the many ways in which the University is building a brighter, healthier and more prosperous Minnesota. This University is indeed vast — with 29,000 employees, 70,000 students and thousands of close-knit microcommunities — so I plan to utilize this new platform to celebrate what truly distinguishes our strong system of campuses.\n\nFor example, we are embarking on systemwide strategic planning, where every member of our community will have an opportunity to shape the future of this great University. Over these next few months, the University will facilitate a series of engagement opportunities — from surveys to town halls — so that we can come together as a community to develop a clear, actionable plan that positions our institution for extraordinary success for generations to come.\n\nThis month, we also are convening three new presidential task forces that are designed to address important issues impacting how our University operates today, and well into the future.\n\nArtificial intelligence is no longer a distant concept — it is a reality that permeates nearly every aspect of our lives. That is why I charged an advisory task force to recommend how our University approaches the evaluation, use and development of emergent AI tools and services. Our ultimate goal is to equip students, faculty and staff with the knowledge and skills necessary to harness the power of AI responsibly and effectively. For more than a century, our St. Paul campus has served as both a rich educational environment and an agricultural experiment station, housing research fields, greenhouses and laboratories. We have a unique opportunity to chart its future course, so I charged a task force to consider opportunities for new collaborations, social hubs and catalyst projects that can effectively position our St. Paul campus as a destination for innovation. I arrived in the Twin Cities at a time when there is a renewed interest in how our University can be greater than the sum of its parts. And so I charged a task force to figure out ways in which we can operate more effectively as a system of campuses. How can we break down barriers and highlight our unique strengths so that every member of the University community can truly excel?\n\nI am confident that 2025 will present plenty of opportunities for us to elevate our reputation as one of America’s leading public research universities, and so I appreciate your perseverance, your leadership and your collaboration as we move onward together.\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nLast night, the White House issued a proclamation suspending entry to the United States for any international student studying at Harvard University on an F or J visa. Singling out our institution for its enrollment of international students and its collaboration with other educational institutions around the world is yet another illegal step taken by the Administration to retaliate against Harvard.\n\n\n\nAs you know, we recently obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining the Administration’s illegal revocation of Harvard’s Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) certification. Last night’s proclamation circumvents that court order. Today, we have amended our lawsuit and will ask the court to immediately halt the enforcement of the proclamation. We hope the court will act swiftly.\n\n\n\nWhile the court considers our request, contingency plans are being developed to ensure that international students and scholars can continue to pursue their work at Harvard this summer and through the coming academic year. School leadership will provide updates on this planning. In addition, the Harvard International Office will be in touch directly with students and scholars who may be affected by the proclamation, also issued last night, banning travel of citizens from certain countries to the United States.\n\n\n\nEach of us is part of a truly global university community. We know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable. International students and scholars make outstanding contributions inside and outside of our classrooms and laboratories, fulfilling our mission of excellence in countless ways. We will celebrate them, support them, and defend their interests as we continue to assert our Constitutional rights.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\n\n\nWe write to let you know that Kannon Shanmugam, an outstanding lawyer and a distinguished graduate of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, will join the Corporation on July 1, 2025. He will succeed Ted Wells, who will step down from the Corporation at the end of June after twelve years of superlative service.\n\n\n\nKannon Shanmugam is one of the nation’s most accomplished and admired appellate attorneys, who has also served an array of educational institutions. Beyond his extensive experience counseling and representing major organizations in complex matters, he is known for his intellectual acuity and curiosity, his remarkable work ethic, his warm and collegial manner, his adroitness in engaging people with varied points of view, and his commitment to academic excellence.\n\n\n\nKannon has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States as well as more than 150 other appeals in courts nationwide, including numerous state courts and all 13 federal courts of appeals. A partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he is founding chair of the firm’s Supreme Court and Appellate Litigation Practice as well as chair of its office in Washington, DC. He was previously a partner at Williams & Connolly and, before that, served in the US Department of Justice’s Office of the Solicitor General.\n\n\n\nThe son of immigrants from India, Kannon is a native of Kansas, where his father served for decades as a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Kansas. Kannon graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College, where he concentrated in classics and was editor in chief of the Harvard Independent. After studying for a master’s degree in classics as a Marshall Scholar at Oxford, he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was executive editor of the Harvard Law Review. He went on to clerk for Judge J. Michael Luttig of the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and for Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nPast cochair of the American Bar Association’s Appellate Practice Committee, Kannon regularly appears in rankings of the country’s leading appellate lawyers. He also has an extensive record of service in education. He chaired the board of trustees of Thurgood Marshall Academy, a public charter high school in Washington, DC. He is a trustee of both the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the University of Kansas Endowment, as well as a past trustee of the Association of Marshall Scholars. He has taught Supreme Court advocacy at Georgetown University Law Center, and he frequently speaks about legal matters to groups of law students and lawyers. His deep devotion to Harvard and to the importance of academic values and academic freedom was abundantly clear during our conversations as part of the search process.\n\n\n\nWe owe profound gratitude to our colleague Ted Wells, who since 2013 has served the Corporation and the University superbly with his powerful mind, his formidable legal expertise, his strong commitment to academic ideals and principled decision-making, and his humane concern for others. In Kannon Shanmugam, we are fortunate to have someone well positioned to carry forward and build on Ted’s remarkable legacy, while bringing fresh perspectives and valuable insights to the hard and important work ahead.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan M. Garber, President\n\n\n\nPenny Pritzker, Senior Fellow, Harvard Corporation\n\n\n\nP.S. A related Harvard Gazette article appears here.",

    "content": "I write to share that Thomas A. Lewis, dean of the Graduate School, will step down from his role at Brown on July 31, 2025, to join Cornell University as Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate School. Known to many as Tal, he will depart Brown after more than 17 years of exemplary service as a faculty member and administrator, having made a lasting impact on graduate education through his thoughtful leadership, collaborative spirit and deep commitment to students.\n\nSince his appointment as interim dean in 2022 and then dean in 2023, Tal has led the Graduate School during a period of meaningful progress. Under his leadership, the University has bolstered support structures for doctoral and MFA students across more than 50 programs, aligning academic excellence with robust student support and financial planning. Tal’s vision has been grounded in the understanding that graduate students play an essential role in the life of the University — both as scholars and as teachers — and his work has focused on ensuring their academic, professional and personal success.\n\nTal strengthened collaborative relationships across the University, building strong partnerships with faculty in academic units, student organizations and, importantly, at the School of Professional Studies, which oversees Brown’s portfolio of more than 30 early-career master’s programs spanning all disciplines. He cultivated a constructive and positive working relationship with the graduate student union, grounded in a shared commitment to student well-being and success. During his leadership, applications to Brown’s doctoral programs increased by 40% over three years, while admissions became more selective and the yield on offers improved.\n\nA cornerstone of his deanship has been the advancement of recommendations from the Task Force on Doctoral Education, which he chaired prior to becoming dean. Tal has championed efforts to enhance advising systems, prepare graduate students for diverse career paths and launch initiatives to improve the student experience. Specific initiatives included requiring all graduate programs to formalize advising expectations and handbooks, and the launch of PhD360, a framework that promotes holistic professional development across six areas of impact. Tal has also prioritized inclusion and equity, implementing programs such as the Mae Williamson Simmons Fellowship program, which provides community building and individualized support for incoming Ph.D. students with a focus on those from underrepresented backgrounds. He has worked to expand access and support for students from historically underrepresented groups and to ensure that the structures of graduate education reflect Brown’s values of diversity and community.\n\nIn addition, Tal has led efforts to improve the graduate program review process, manage enrollment growth strategically, and extend support for students impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout, he has been a tireless advocate for graduate education and a visible contributor to the intellectual life of the University through his continued involvement in the Department of Religious Studies and interdisciplinary areas such as the Cogut Institute for the Humanities.\n\nA proud Brown alumnus, Tal earned his A.B. in religious studies in 1990 before pursuing a Ph.D. at Stanford. He returned to Brown in 2007 as a faculty member in religious studies, where he taught courses and served as both director of undergraduate studies and director of graduate studies. He served as associate dean of academic affairs in the Graduate School from 2016 to 2022, as well as co-deputy dean. A distinguished scholar in religious ethics and the philosophy of religion in the modern West, Tal has published three books and numerous articles, and held fellowships at institutions including Princeton University.\n\nTal’s connection to Brown has always been deeply personal. He has often spoken of his admiration for the intellectual curiosity that defines the Brown community and the sense of purpose that binds its members. That perspective has shaped his leadership and left a mark on graduate education across the University. We will greatly miss Tal’s clarity of vision, warmth and steady leadership. Please join me in expressing our deep gratitude for his many contributions and in wishing him continued success in his new role at Cornell, where he will coordinate graduate education, aligning it with broader academic goals and overseeing 80 advanced degree programs across more than a dozen schools and colleges.\n\nWe will announce plans for interim leadership and the launch of a search for the next dean of the Graduate School in the coming weeks.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III\n\nProvost",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Brown Community,\n\nI am pleased to share that Sandra Smith has been appointed the next dean of Brown’s School of Professional Studies (SPS), effective July 1, 2025.\n\nSandra brings over 25 years of experience in higher education, strategic consulting and private industry — and has already demonstrated adept leadership as interim dean of SPS since January. As dean, she will oversee academic programs, operations, finances and staff, while leading efforts to advance the school’s mission to create and deliver programs that empower learners at all career stages to transform themselves, their workplaces and the communities they serve. Her responsibilities will include developing and managing a growing portfolio of degree and non-degree programs, expanding access to new learner populations, and overseeing resources and initiatives to support SPS students and employees. In addition, she will support other schools and academic departments in expanding master's programs by providing enrollment management, student services and career support for all master’s students. Sandra will report to me and serve on the president’s cabinet, the president’s executive committee and the provost’s leadership group of senior academic deans.\n\nSandra was selected following an international search facilitated by a Brown faculty advisory committee. Throughout the process, she impressed faculty, staff and University leaders with her strategic vision, deep understanding of Brown’s collaborative culture and inclusive leadership style. She brings a powerful combination of entrepreneurial thinking and academic rigor — qualities that will be essential as SPS aims to expand its reach and impact. Colleagues described Sandra as a thoughtful listener who cultivates trust, builds consensus and translates ideas into action with integrity and accountability.\n\nSandra’s perspective on the future of SPS aligns strongly with Brown’s priorities and strengths. She sees the school evolving into a leading hub for lifelong learning, with offerings that span certificates to master’s degrees and meet students where they are in their personal and professional journeys. Her approach is distinctly Brown, drawing on the University’s excellence across a full range of disciplines and integrating insights from multiple disciplines including the humanities, social and applied sciences to prepare ethical leaders with the skills needed for professional success.\n\nAs interim dean, Sandra has already advanced Brown’s priorities in professional education. She has led the development of three new online master’s programs, strengthened collaboration with faculty across academic departments and laid the groundwork for SPS to grow, with a strong commitment to academic quality and fiscal responsibility. Prior to becoming interim dean, she helped to establish and grow the Master in Technology Leadership program and launched the non-credit portfolio at Brown in her previous role as senior associate dean for executive education. Her professional background includes leadership roles at Charles Schwab and Bell Canada and consulting roles with Boston Consulting Group and Recon Strategy. Sandra holds an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and both a master of applied science and a bachelor’s degree with honors in industrial engineering from the University of Toronto.\n\nSandra’s unique blend of academic experience and business acumen positions her to lead SPS in ways that are responsive to evolving student needs and grounded in Brown’s values. Her understanding of the work and careers across multiple sectors, organizational leadership, and the skills needed for professional success will enable her to lead the creation of programs that are academically rigorous, financially sustainable and in demand from students and employers alike.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Sandra and thanking the members of the search committee for their thoughtful and dedicated work throughout this successful search.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrancis J. Doyle III\n\nProvost",

    "content": "Dear Johns Hopkins University Community,\n\nIt has been a difficult several months as we, and our colleagues across higher education, navigate reductions and uncertainties in federal research support, as well as changes in federal policy, including recent efforts to limit or withhold visas from the international students and scholars who are valued members of our community and key contributors to our academic and research mission.\n\nWe write today to update the Hopkins community on what we are facing, how we are responding, and what we anticipate.\n\nChallenges to our Mission\n\nAs many of you know first-hand, we continue to experience a steady stream of research grant terminations, suspensions, and delays. We shared in March the loss of more than $800 million at Hopkins from USAID grant terminations. Since January, we also have had 90 grants terminated by other agencies, resulting in the loss of more than $50 million in federal research funding, with more terminations arriving nearly every week.\n\nMoreover, we are seeing a marked decline in the pipeline of new federal research awards at Hopkins, down by nearly two-thirds since January, compared to the same period last year, despite continued high scores and an increase in submissions by our researchers. We fear that this downward trend may be laying the groundwork for deep cuts to the extramural research programs at the NIH, NSF, DOD and DOE—further fraying the extraordinary and longstanding research partnership between universities and the federal government and significantly curtailing Hopkins’ capacity to undertake our core academic and research mission and to sustain the people who allow us to realize it.\n\nSimilarly, the recent moves by the federal government to revoke or withhold visas from eligible international students and scholars run counter to more than a century of collaboration at Hopkins with students and scholars who hail from around the world. Our international community has always been critical to our research mission, and we are deeply concerned about the toll of this uncertainty on our students and on our university as a whole, with every division set to welcome current and prospective international students, faculty, and staff who choose to make their home at Johns Hopkins.\n\nOn the horizon, too, are a host of proposed actions that are gaining steam in Congress and will seriously impair our ability to carry out our mission, including a proposed cap on the reimbursement rate for research-related facilities and administrative costs, which could reduce our federal research funding by more than $300 million annually; a proposed increase in the endowment tax (and changes to its calculation), which would undermine student financial aid and faculty support funds; proposed cuts to Medicaid, which risks excluding vulnerable patients and increasing the cost of care provided by our School of Medicine faculty and the Johns Hopkins Health System; and proposed cuts to the federal Grad PLUS loan program and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program for medical residents.\n\nBudget Implications and Planning\n\nAlthough the precise timing and impact of funding reductions will vary across our divisions—depending on funding sources, student composition, and other factors—many parts of the university are already experiencing the effects of these developments and facing uncertainties about the future.\n\nIn close collaboration with the deans, and in consultation with our partners in shared governance, including the Faculty Budget Advisory Committee (FBAC) and Johns Hopkins University Council (JHUC), we have been working to develop strategies to ameliorate the impact of these challenges on our people and to plan for various scenarios ahead. These include a focus on immediate steps we can take to preserve funds to protect our workforce while we await final federal budgets; moderate but meaningful further expense reductions in our baseline budgets for the next academic year; and ongoing exploration of more aggressive actions down the road if needed to safeguard our core mission.\n\nIn that spirit, the following steps will be implemented immediately to shore up university and divisional finances through this period of uncertainty:\n\nPausing annual pay increases. We have resolved to delay decisions on annual pay increases for most employees. Increases that typically take effect on July 1 will be paused for all employees earning more than $80,000 per year. This pause will allow time to understand the full nature and magnitude of the federal government’s proposed changes. If our financial outlook stabilizes in the coming months, we will reevaluate the pause, with a view to implement increases in January 2026. Employees earning $80,000 or less per year on a full-time equivalent basis who are not part of a bargaining unit will receive a 2% annual increase effective July 1.\n\nFreezing staff hiring. Effective immediately, we will implement a staff hiring freeze across the university for new and existing positions. Divisional leadership will retain discretion for approving exceptions to this temporary measure, including for mission-critical positions and those covered by grants or other restricted funds.\n\nSlowing capital projects. Over the last several years, the university has embarked on an extensive capital renewal campaign with strategic investments in projects involving research, academic space, and student life. Prudence dictates cutting back our ambitions in the near term, and we have decided to reduce our capital construction and renovation plans by approximately 10-20%. Final decisions on these reductions will be made over the summer in consultation with the divisions, with an emphasis on continuing mission-critical projects, essential deferred maintenance, and projects that are already far along in the permitting, demolition, and construction process.\n\nReducing spending and increasing efficiency. Across the university, discretionary spending will be reduced on expenses such as travel, food, supplies, and professional services. These reductions will vary by division, and deans or divisional leadership will provide specific guidance in the coming days. We also are working within university administration and each division to find additional opportunities to increase revenue and reduce costs by operating more efficiently. Some of these projects are already underway; others will be integrated into our financial planning in the months ahead.\n\nLater this month, we will host a Community Updates webinar on these steps and the overall budgetary landscape. Details will be available via the Hub, and we hope you will bring your questions for university leaders.\n\nOur Ongoing Efforts\n\nFinally, as we shared in April, we are continuing to advocate and take steps to address the impacts of these federal actions on Johns Hopkins and higher education. We are working individually and collectively with our peers—through organizations like the American Association of Universities (AAU), as well as patient groups and research coalitions—to challenge the cuts to F&A (indirect cost recovery), for example, and to ensure that the story of our research impact and the university-government research partnership born in the embers of WWII is reaching critical audiences. The case for the unparallelled bounty of this compact is strong, and the contraction of research universities’ activities cannot help but diminish American progress, scientific advancement, and the health and welfare of citizens everywhere.\n\nWe also are closely monitoring federal actions affecting our international students and scholars and providing a range of supports and resources through our Office of International Services (OIS). And, we are continuing to be both scrupulous in our compliance with the law and thoughtful in how we sustain our capacity to be a place that prizes pluralism in all its respects, advances opportunity, and combats discrimination, including through new online courses to ensure that every member of our community understandsour commitment to antidiscrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nInformation on these topics, and more, is available on a new website, which we hope you will look to not only for federal updates but also for inspiring stories of the incredible work and discoveries that are happening here at Hopkins every day. Share it—as well as your own stories—with others to highlight how Johns Hopkins’ longstanding partnership with the federal government has made the nation and world healthier and safer.\n\nWe know that these are uncertain times, and we appreciate your unwavering commitment to research, teaching, and clinical care; to academic excellence; and to the well-being of the Hopkins community. Together, with transparency, resilience, and compassion, we will continue to uphold our mission and advance our vital work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRon Daniels\n\nPresident\n\nRay Jayawardhana\n\nProvost\n\nLaurent Heller\n\nExecutive Vice President for Finance and Administration",

    "content": "Dear Pomona College community,\n\nSince our founding, Pomona has aspired to bring together the brightest students with the most exceptional instructors for an unrivalled education. Since our earliest days, international students have been core to the unique learning environment at the College, and they are essential members of our Sagehen community.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration announced two policies that impact international students, and we recognize the implications are both confusing and deeply unsettling for the Pomona community and more broadly for the nation. This is a rapidly evolving situation, and while much remains unclear, please know that we are here to support you as we continue to learn more.\n\nTo summarize, the administration has ordered U.S. Embassies and consular sections to pause scheduling new interviews for student visa applicants until a new social media vetting process has been codified. This immediate pause will continue until further guidance is issued, purportedly in the next few days.\n\nWhat this means: The U.S. government has suspended all new appointments for anyone pursuing F and J visas. (For clarity’s sake: An F visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows foreign nationals to study in the U.S. J visas, or “Exchange Visitor Visas,” are similar and allow foreign nationals to participate in approved educational and cultural exchange programs in the U.S.). Our consultants in Washington, D.C. have advised that the government is currently proceeding with previously scheduled appointments. However, we have heard from other contacts that some appointments have been cancelled (although not those of Pomona students).\n\nAdditionally, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration intends to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” from both the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong. Along with our colleagues in D.C. and across higher education, we are closely tracking the impacts of the administration’s announcement pertaining to Chinese students. We have no other information at this time, but will share any developments as we learn them.\n\nOur Office of International Student & Scholar Services is rapidly reaching out to incoming and international students to provide support and resources. Assistant Director of International Student & Scholar Services Kathy Quispe urges all international students who have not completed their paperwork and/ or scheduled their visa appointments to quickly do so. All international students with questions should contact Kathy.\n\nPomona is fortunate that international students of exceptional ability and dedication are drawn here to pursue their education. They strengthen every aspect of the College’s life, and we will do all we can to help them navigate this challenging landscape. If you know students affected, I encourage you to remind them of their value to the community and urge them to contact the Office of International Student & Scholar Services for support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBob\n\nRobert Gaines\n\nActing President\n\nEdwin F. and Martha Hahn Professor of Geology",

    "content": "Dear Members of the Sarah Lawrence Community,\n\nJust over a week ago we marked the end of the academic year with a beautiful graduation ceremony. The downpour on the day could do nothing to dampen the spirits of the Class of 2025 (who, after all, were welcomed to campus four years ago by Hurricane Henri!). If you missed our 97th Commencement, or want to rewatch any parts, please visit our Commencement recap site, where you will find photo galleries and videos of the ceremony. We were delighted this year to welcome as our commencement speaker fashion and footwear icon Sam Edelman '73, a member of a multi-generational family of SLC alums, who delivered a touching and inspiring keynote address. And we were proud to bestow an honorary degree upon pioneering choreographer and performer Lucinda Childs '62, who also shared inspirational words with our graduates. In addition to the graduation ceremony, the recap site also features photos and a full video from our Graduate Hooding, held the night before Commencement to recognize our graduate students and their accomplishments in pursuit of advanced degrees.\n\nCongratulations once again to the Class of 2025, and to the families and friends who supported them so steadfastly on their journey to this moment.\n\nCommencement week rightly shines a spotlight on the relationship between students and faculty as a core value of a Sarah Lawrence education. Whether it’s via meaningful moments at the Senior/Faculty Gala, the senior lecture, this year delivered by esteemed Art History faculty member Jerrilynn Dodds, or the rousing ovation students gave faculty during Commencement, we are reminded of the foundational importance of these relationships.\n\nOur Board of Trustees convened for its May meeting immediately following Commencement, and, among other actions, voted unanimously to confer tenure upon two faculty members: An Li (Economics) and Caden Manson(Theatre). Congratulations and my gratitude to An and Caden for all they bring to Sarah Lawrence College!\n\nFaculty have been in the news quite a bit of late, with longtime Writing faculty member Marie Howe winning the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry for her work, New and Selected Poems, and Dance program director and choreographer John Jasperse ’85 earning a rave review in The New York Times for his latest work, “Tides”. Last month, I Am You, the forthcoming novel by Writing faculty member Victoria Redel, enjoyed an exclusive reveal on the TODAY show. I encourage you to visit our News page from time to time to follow the extraordinary achievements of our faculty, students, and alumni.\n\nLast but most certainly not least, I share with you the retirements of three esteemed and beloved faculty members on whom the Board conferred Faculty Emeritus status in recognition of their distinguished careers and their inimitable contributions to our community: Roland Dollinger (German), Eduardo Lago (Spanish), and Thomas Young (Music). Between them, Roland, Eduardo, and Thomas taught at SLC for more than 100 years — longer than Sarah Lawrence has been a college! — mentoring and inspiring generations of students and earning the deep respect of their faculty and staff colleagues along the way.\n\n***\n\nAs is true for many members of our campus community, summer takes on a different rhythm for me from the academic year. It’s a time when I take part in annual meetings with other presidents under the aegis of groups like the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Annapolis Group, among others. This year there will be more such meetings and convenings than usual as college and university presidents continue the important collective work laid out in the American Association of Colleges and Universities’ “Call for Constructive Engagement”, signed by me and more than 650 others, and address the ever increasing array of issues confronting higher education for which a concise summary is provided here. It’s also a time when I have the privilege of mentoring new presidents, serving as a faculty member of the Harvard Seminar for New Presidents. And it’s a time of intensive planning work on campus with members of the senior leadership team among others. Finally, it’s a time when I catch up with alumni!\n\nI look forward to seeing many of you at Reunion, on campus from June 5-8. I will deliver my annual Year in Review on Saturday, June 7, and what a year it has been — and continues to be! That report will offer an opportunity for me to share reflections on the extraordinary accomplishments of this year as well as the turbulence surrounding U.S. higher education and what Sarah Lawrence is doing as we navigate these challenges. I look forward to sharing that with many of you in person and in the June issue of this newsletter. Until then, I wish you a happy, healthy start to summer and offer my congratulations again to the Class of 2025!\n\nYours,\n\nCristle Collins Judd\n\nPresident\n\npresident@sarahlawrence.edu\n\nInstagram: @slcprez",

    "content": "Members of the Class of 2025:\n\nFamily members, friends, professors, staff, mentors who have helped our graduates along the way...Congratulations!\n\nGraduation is a team sport, as are so many of life’s great achievements. This moment belongs to all of you.\n\nThank you for allowing me to be part of your special day.\n\nWe are fortunate to be joined by so many individuals who are living examples of how you can build on your college experience to lead a life of service and purpose.\n\nI want to thank Major General Charles Bolden for his remarks and his willingness to invest in the next generation of leaders by sharing some of the lessons he’s learned along his own life’s journey.\n\nGeneral Bolden, your words and actions are an example to us all. Thank you.\n\nI also want to express my gratitude to our Distinguished Service Award recipients for all they’ve done for our university, the State of Ohio and our community.\n\nAnd I extend my congratulations to our honorary degree recipient, Dr. Gawande.\n\nIt would be easy to look at the resumes of the individuals we’ve honored today and think, “I’m not sure I could do that.”\n\nWhether they’ve flown into space, authored a bestselling book, pioneered new medical treatments, built successful businesses or become pillars in their communities, this is certainly an accomplished group of people.\n\nBut look closer.\n\nThe people on this stage have something in common. Something that is an example to all of us. Something the world needs more of.\n\nThey have all answered a call to serve the greater good.\n\nThis is a lesson to us all. Each and every one of us can live a life of service.\n\nThat may take the form of public service, or philanthropy, or community leadership or military service. It may mean raising a family or doing the everyday things that make our community a better place.\n\nThe point is, we all have an opportunity and a calling to be a force for good.\n\nWith the Ohio State degree you are earning today, I know you will answer that call, and make the world a better place.\n\nAnd when you set out to create good, there’s a multiplier effect. Each act of service, each positive interaction with another person, has an impact far beyond what you might think possible.\n\nThe journey will not always be easy.\n\nI can tell you this from my own life experience. Things will not always go as you planned. There will be difficult and unexpected challenges.\n\nYou’ve already seen this up close and personal. Many of you were in high school at a time when our world was facing an unprecedented crisis.\n\nYou may have had to miss or modify some of the rites of passage traditionally associated with this period of your life.\n\nMore than once, you had to change direction on a moment’s notice.\n\nAnd I know that beyond the challenges that made it into the headlines, most of you have been dealt your own private challenges.\n\nYou have responded as Buckeyes do.\n\nYou’ve worked hard, you’ve stayed the course, you’ve treated others with the grace and compassion they deserve, and you’ve made it here, to this day, your graduation.\n\nAnd what an achievement this is.\n\nThe choice you have made to invest in yourself with a college education is one of the wisest decisions you will ever make.\n\nThis degree is something no one can ever take away. The relationships you have formed and memories you have made as a Buckeye will last a lifetime.\n\nThe things you’ve learned – the ideas and concepts you’ve discussed and debated in the classroom as well as the skills you’ve gained outside our buildings – will serve you for the rest of your lives.\n\nYou leave here knowing HOW to think, not what to think. You know how to engage with people and ideas different from your own. You have built a curiosity about the world and a passion for lifelong learning.\n\nYou may not fully realize it sitting here today, but you have changed the trajectory of your life forever.\n\nI have seen it time and time again. There is no more transformative force in a person’s life than education.\n\nApproximately 12,000 degrees are being earned today, and each carries a unique story.\n\nBy the way, each diploma that will be awarded today also bears the unique name of the graduate who earned it. That’s a special touch that sets Ohio State apart.\n\nI wish I could tell all 12,000 of those stories. But I know you are eager to celebrate the day. So I will share just a few.\n\nLet me say this. The Buckeye Class of 2025 is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWe have Jordan Loeffler, a chemical and biomolecular engineering graduate who used her senior thesis project to develop a therapeutic agent for a genetic disease that will change lives.\n\nWe have Katelyn Abeln, an Olympian who competed in Paris in the air pistol event.\n\nWe have Christopher Ayoub, an M.D./Ph.D. graduate pursuing new treatments for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. A powerful reminder that research done at America’s universities not only changes lives, but literally saves lives.\n\nWe have stories of remarkable grit, resilience and perseverance.\n\nLike Theodore Schwartz, an 88-year-old who attended Ohio State in the 1950s and is now earning his diploma.\n\nAnd Lorenzo Styles, a Buckeye football great who began his degree, went on to a successful career in the NFL, and has now come back to finish what he started.\n\nAnd so many more.\n\nStories like these are exactly what our land-grant public university is all about.\n\nThey are exactly what we’re talking about when we cite Ohio State’s motto of “Education for Citizenship.”\n\nThe students we’re celebrating today are exactly the reason our university exists… The reason we come to work every day.\n\nAnd I know each and every one of you has an equally meaningful story – filled with hopes and dreams, ups and downs, and your own special memories of what it means to be a Buckeye.\n\nYou may be graduating today, but remember that you are a part of the Buckeye family forever.\n\nOn behalf of the entire leadership team of Ohio State University, I am so proud of you, and so excited for all that you will accomplish in the years ahead.\n\nWe will be cheering you on every step of the way.\n\nNow, go change the world.",

    "content": "May 29, 2025\n\nDear Tufts community members,\n\nI write to share that Monroe France, our vice provost for institutional inclusive excellence, will be stepping down from his position on June 27 to return home to New York and focus more deeply on his research, scholarship, and consulting work. This is not a decision that has come lightly or abruptly; Monroe shared his decision with me earlier in the semester after considerable reflection. While we will miss his day-to-day presence, he will continue to be a part of the Tufts community through his professor of the practice appointment at Tisch College.\n\nMonroe has been a driving force since arriving at Tufts in April of 2023. His expertise, strategic partnership, and care for our university community have been profound. He joined Tufts at a critical moment and has helped us take a meaningful step forward in advancing inclusive excellence. He first embedded himself within the community, engaging in a multitude of listening sessions with faculty, staff, and students to understand the university and build relationships. He also initiated and completed a secondary analysis of our first-ever university-wide campus climate survey. Both of these efforts served as the foundation for the work he and his team are now leading through ELEVATE, a multi-year effort to create a set of university-wide goals for advancing institutional inclusive excellence and make significant coordinated institutional progress toward achieving those goals.\n\nMonroe, a leader who challenged us all to lean into possibilities, helped reimagine and restructure his office around institutional inclusive excellence, building a cohesive, values driven, and collaborative team. Under his leadership, they developed a framework for dialogue, learning and inclusive leadership for faculty, staff, and students, strengthening partnerships with Tisch College to support these efforts. In support of faculty innovation, they developed a strategy for inclusive faculty development and engagement. Similarly, in support of our staff, they intentionally developed programming for staff and administrative excellence. Collectively, this team continues to create purposeful spaces for community and reflection and increased partnership with our associate and assistant deans for inclusive excellence and other key stakeholders, including alumni.\n\nOn a personal note, I want to acknowledge how much I, along with the rest of my senior team, the deans, and colleagues across the university, have valued Monroe’s partnership, counsel, and leadership, particularly as we have navigated the changing landscape of higher education.\n\nI recognize Monroe’s departure comes at an unprecedented time in higher education when many in our community are feeling vulnerable. I want to take this opportunity to affirm our commitment to both our university values and inclusive excellence. The work of the Office of the Vice Provost for Institutional Inclusive Excellence remains pivotal, and we will continue to build on its accomplishments over the past two years. On an interim basis, Alaina Macaulay, assistant vice provost for inclusive excellence and leadership, will lead the office and serve as a member of my senior team. Alaina is well positioned to take on this role as her scope of experience has been expansive. Prior to joining Tufts, she held several key leadership roles, most recently at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she oversaw inclusion and strategic engagement actively managing a portfolio of inclusive learning communities, employee resource groups, advisory councils, campus engagement fund, inclusion taskforces, and large-scale university programming. She continues to collaborate with scholars and practitioners nationwide, advancing inclusive excellence and driving transformative change in higher education leadership and practice. At Tufts, she has directly managed the program staff and the day-to-day operations of the office and has had strategic leadership over ELEVATE, which will continue under her leadership.\n\nWe will share more about our next steps with this leadership transition when we can. Meanwhile, in the coming weeks, Monroe and Alaina will provide an update about ELEVATE and the work planned for the summer.\n\nPlease join me in extending my sincere gratitude to Monroe and wishing him the best of luck in his future endeavors. He holds my deep admiration and appreciation.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nCaroline\n\nCaroline Attardo Genco\n\nProvost and Senior Vice President",

We hope to reach a fair and comprehensive agreement over the coming weeks that both sides can find acceptable. See a summary of the College’s most recent proposal.\n\n\n\nWe are pleased that the union has decided to enter into mediation with the College in an effort to finalize a contract. Both parties have agreed to an initial meeting on June 12 (and may be scheduling future meetings) and to ground rules for mediation. Because these rules include a commitment to maintaining the confidentiality of all information presented and statements made during mediated sessions, the College will not be able to update the community on what occurs in mediation. We will, however, continue to operate according to the principles that have guided us throughout the negotiations. These include:\n\nPrioritizing the education of our students, and the strength and continuity of our academic program.\n\nRecognizing the vital and distinct role NTT faculty play in supporting our students and our academic mission.\n\nRespecting the collective bargaining process and our commitment to negotiating in good faith.\n\nSecuring a fair and competitive contract that recognizes the contributions of our NTT faculty as well as the needs and priorities of the broader community and the College.\n\nThank you for your continued dedication to the College and our academic mission. We wish all of you a restorative summer, and we look forward to being able to share news with you at a later date.",

    "content": "May 29, 2025\n\nMembers of the Rutgers Community,\n\nAfter a year-long national search marked by tremendous participation across Rutgers University–Newark, I am delighted to join with President-Designate William F. Tate IV in announcing the appointment of Tonya Smith-Jackson as Chancellor of Rutgers–Newark, effective August 1.\n\nCurrently Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T), the nation’s largest HBCU, Dr. Smith-Jackson is a human factors engineer and a supremely talented and effective higher education leader. She was selected from among a stellar group of finalists recruited by the search committee chaired by Professor Salamishah Tillet and Executive Vice President Prabhas Moghe, emerging as the clear choice to lead Rutgers–Newark and build on its momentum as a Top 50 public research university and model anchor institution.\n\nDr. Smith-Jackson, who holds a doctorate in psychology/ergonomics and an interdisciplinary Master of Science degree in psychology and industrial engineering, has served at NC A&T since 2013, where she chaired its Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. At the university, she also directed a cybersecurity center, the Human Factors Analytics Lab, and the laboratory for Cyber-Human Analytics Research for the Internet of Things. In her current role, Dr. Smith-Jackson has been responsible for, among other accomplishments, the creation of three new doctoral programs, the state’s first bachelor's degree program in artificial intelligence, and dramatic increases in both research staff and graduate assistants at NC A&T.\n\nPrior to NC A&T, she served on the Industrial and Systems Engineering faculty at Virginia Tech for 14 years, worked as an engineer at IBM and Ericsson Mobile Communications, and taught at several other higher education institutions. She also served for a year at the National Science Foundation (2018-19) as program director in the NSF’s Cyber-Human Systems Program.\n\nTonya Smith-Jackson is a person of principles and values who has dedicated her professional life to making transformative changes in higher education, and she is deeply committed to the mission of Rutgers University–Newark. President-Designate Tate and I have met with her and are excited for the energy, wisdom, talent, and leadership that Dr. Smith-Jackson will bring to her role as Chancellor.\n\nI am deeply grateful to Interim Chancellor Jeffrey Robinson for the phenomenal job he has done in leading Rutgers–Newark over the past year—and for Jeff’s willingness to extend his interim appointment through July. I also want to thank Salamishah, Prabhas, and all the members of the search committee for their dedication and teamwork, which have resulted in such an exciting appointment.\n\nPlease join us in welcoming Chancellor Tonya Smith-Jackson to Rutgers this summer.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJonathan Holloway\n\nPresident and University Professor",

    "content": "Rockland County, NY (June 5, 2025) — Rockland Community College (RCC) is proud to announce a new agreement with St. Thomas Aquinas College (STAC) that will make it easier for students who earn an Associate of Science in Human Performance Studies – Exercise and Sport Science at RCC and then transfer to STAC to continue their academic journey toward a Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science.\n\nThrough this partnership, eligible RCC graduates can transfer up to 70 credits into STAC’s Exercise Science program, which includes concentrations in Allied Health or Kinesiology. Students must complete all required courses for the undergraduate degree at STAC but will enter with advanced standing thanks to this comprehensive credit transfer agreement.\n\n“This agreement reflects our commitment to providing RCC students with strong, affordable, and accessible transfer opportunities to continue their education,” said Patti Zodda, Professor and Program Director of the Human Performance and Wellness Department. “We’re excited to expand our partnership with STAC and open new doors for students pursuing careers in health, wellness, and human performance.”\n\nIn addition to guaranteed credit transfer, the agreement provides a range of financial benefits for RCC students:\n\nStudents with a minimum 2.5 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) will qualify for transfer scholarships to reduce the cost of tuition at STAC.\n\nStudents who live on campus at STAC will receive free housing for their first semester (meal plan not included).\n\nStudents who commute will be eligible for a $2,000 commuter grant per academic year.\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Rockland Community College to support student success in the growing field of Exercise Science,” said Joy Gallagher, Assistant Director of Admissions for Transfer Students at St. Thomas Aquinas College. “This agreement underscores our shared mission to promote educational opportunity and make four-year degrees more attainable.”\n\nSTAC will also offer housing options for RCC students who transfer into the program, ensuring a smooth and supportive transition into campus life for those who choose to live on-site.

    "content": "ROCKLAND COUNTY, N.Y. (June 2, 2025) – Morenikeji Fashipe and Natalia Benitez Levina, both recent graduates of Rockland Community College, have been awarded the Cooke Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship. This year, more than 1,600 students from community colleges nationwide applied to receive the Cooke Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship. The final group of 90 Scholars was selected from a semifinalist pool of 467 applicants. The Foundation evaluated each submission based on the student’s academic ability and achievement, financial need, persistence, and leadership.\n\nFashipe and Levina are among the 90 community college students nationwide selected for this highly competitive award, which is designed to help outstanding students complete their undergraduate education with as little debt as possible. The award, which is “last dollar funding” after all institutional aid, can provide these students with as much as $55,000 a year for up to three years to complete a bachelor’s degree.\n\nDuring the application process, many of this year’s recipients were supported by a faculty or staff member serving as a Campus Representative. Dr. Meghan P. Nolan, MFA, MA, PhD, Chair of the Sam Draper Honors Program and Associate Professor of English helped promote the Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship and supported students who chose to apply. Her work was invaluable to the selection process.\n\nMorenikeji Fashipe is a graduate of Rockland Community College’s Sam Draper Honors Program, where she majored in Natural and Physical Sciences. At RCC, she served as president of both the Wonder Girls Club and Phi Theta Kappa’s Alpha Phi Sigma Chapter, and was active as a Sustainability Club member, math tutor, student leader, mentor, and ambassador. Driven by a strong commitment to service, she organized annual food drives, supported the campus garden and daycare, and volunteered with the West Haverstraw Ambulance Corps. A vocal advocate for her peers, she brought student concerns to campus leadership and served on the Middle States and Graduation Committees. This fall, she will transfer to Binghamton University to major in Biological Sciences with a minor in Public Health, with plans to attend medical school and become an anesthesiologist.\n\n“Morenikeji is the kind of student every educator hopes to encounter. She is intelligent, driven, and deeply compassionate,” said Meghan P. Nolan, MFA, MA, PhD, Associate Professor of English, Chair of the Sam Draper Honors Program at SUNY Rockland Community College. “She not only excelled academically, but consistently uplifted those around her through mentorship, advocacy, and service. Her impact on our campus community has been profound, and I have no doubt she will continue to do great things in the medical field and beyond.”\n\nNatalia Benitez Levina is a Cuban-born professional pianist currently residing in Nyack, New York. A classically trained concert pianist and accompanist, she graduated from the Music Conservatory of Matanzas “EPA” in 2021. While in Cuba, she developed a passion for TV and film production, which led her to study Media Communications at Rockland Community College. Natalia joined the Sam Draper Honors Program and served as the Honors Student Assistant. She was actively involved on campus, serving as one of the Vice President of both the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society’s Alpha Phi Sigma Chapter and the Honors Newsletter. She participated in numerous events and competitions, including the Pioneers of Change contest, where her poem about Celia Cruz earned third place. She recently graduated with an A.S. in Communications Media Arts and a 3.98 GPA. Natalia will be attending Pace University in the fall to major in Communication and Media Studies with a minor in Arts Management. Her goal is to produce and write scripts and scores for television, blending her dual passions for music and media.\n\n“Natalia is a rare blend of artistic talent and academic excellence,” said Meghan P. Nolan, MFA, MA, PhD, Associate Professor of English, Chair of the Sam Draper Honors Program at SUNY Rockland Community College. “Her dedication to both music and media is inspiring, and she brought that same passion and creativity to every project she touched on campus. Whether performing on stage, writing for the Honors Newsletter, or exploring new forms of storytelling, Natalia consistently impressed us with her vision, leadership, and drive. I’m excited to see how she continues to merge her talents at Pace and beyond.”\n\n“This year’s cohort reflects the remarkable talent and determination thriving in community colleges nationwide,” said Giuseppe “Seppy” Basili, Executive Director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. “As we mark 25 years of impact, we remain committed to amplifying the successes of these students and opening doors to the opportunities they deserve.”\n\nAlong with financial support, new Cooke Undergraduate Transfer Scholars will receive comprehensive educational advising to guide them through the process of transitioning to a four-year college and preparing for their careers. Scholars will additionally receive opportunities for internships, study abroad, and graduate school funding, as well as connection to a thriving network of more than 3,400 Cooke Scholars and Alumni.\n\nAbout the Cooke Foundation\n\nThe Cooke Foundation is dedicated to advancing the education of exceptionally promising students who have financial need. Since 2000, the Foundation has awarded $304 million in scholarships to more than 3,400 students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive academic advising, career pathway counseling and other support services. The Foundation has also provided $136 million in grants to organizations that serve such students. www.jkcf.org\n\n# # #",

    "content": "Remarks by President Sarah Bolton at Whitman College’s 139th Commencement ceremony held on Sunday, May 25, 2025:\n\nClass of 2025, we are here to celebrate you. We celebrate today because of who you are, and the great work you have done here at Whitman. And we celebrate you because of who you will be and the impact you will make in the world.\n\nFifty years ago, Reginald Green ’55, a diplomat who had worked around the world, was the commencement speaker for the class of 1975. In that time of great challenge—just after the conclusion of the Vietnam war—he posed hard questions about what actions individuals, communities and nations must take to bring about a more just, thriving and sustainable world. The class of 1975, many of whom are with us today, carried those questions out from their commencement, and answered them in hundreds of ways, through their lives and work. Now they stand ready to support your futures as you answer those questions for your own time.\n\nClass of 2025, today we celebrate your amazing individual talents and accomplishments, but also who you are as a community. You started college at a time of tremendous isolation. Together, you rebuilt the life of this college as our campus—and the world—gradually reopened. But you did much more than just bring Whitman “back to normal”. Together, you made a new, even stronger, Whitman—one that is even more welcoming, more vibrant and more inspiring. One that has new student organizations, new ways of building community, new landscapes, new ways serving communities in Walla Walla and around the world. Together, you found new ways to learn about the greatest challenges of this time, and new ways to work for a better future. You have rebuilt Whitman, and now you give it to the students who follow you. What an extraordinary gift, and legacy.\n\nClass of 2025, you are now poised to commence in the finest way, with knowledge, courage and wisdom, with deep care for the world and the ability to understand it from a wide range of viewpoints. Just as you have built so much that is lasting here, you will make a difference in the world, and your futures are incredibly bright. Congratulations!",

Here at the University of Washington, we are fortunate to be home to Hillel UW and Chabad UW, as well as the Stroum Center for Jewish Studies, which offer opportunities for comradery, celebration and learning.\n\nThis year HillelFEST celebrated the amazing impact that Amee Sherer has had in her decade leading Hillel at the University. The Stroum Center celebrated its 50th anniversary, and this winter, Chabad House hosted the first ever JewDub concert in Red Square to celebrate Jewish pride.\n\nSadly, Jewish Heritage Month is also an opportunity to reflect on the long shadow that antisemitism continues to cast across the world. This was most recently made all too clear by the murders of Israeli embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim Yaron, a poignant reminder that too many Jewish community members everywhere, including right here on our campuses, fear for their safety and that of their loved ones.\n\nThere is a better way, and I implore every member of our UW community to reach for it — to engage in dialogue over destruction, to seek common ground instead of conflict. As a democracy and multicultural society, we must show that we are capable of talking across our differences and of tolerating disagreement without resorting to violence.\n\nTogether, we must build a society in which peaceful actions beget peaceful outcomes and in which dialogue fosters understanding and progress toward a more just world.",

    "content": "To the Temple Community,\n\nEarlier this afternoon, at approximately 1 p.m., Temple University Police Officers responded to reports of an assault on the 3400 block of N.Broad Street at our Health Sciences Center campus. Upon arriving, they found a Temple Health employee who had been struck from behind and knocked to the ground and sustained injuries. They were transported to the Temple University Hospital Emergency Room where they received treatment.\n\nThis incident is deeply unsettling, as no student or employee should fear for their safety while walking down a public street. The Department of Public Safety Investigations Unit is currently investigating the incident, reviewing all video footage, and exhausting all leads. They immediately released a picture of a person of interest to seek the public’s assistance in identifying the individual. Fortunately, due to Investigations’ quick action, a person of interest is currently being detained as the investigation continues.\n\nThe safety of our students, faculty and staff will always be our top priority, and we are grateful for the efforts of our police officers, who responded swiftly and our detectives who are investigating the incident.\n\nWe encourage students, faculty and staff to continuously familiarize themselves with the university’s available safety resources, like the walking escort program and Flight. More safety resources can be found at safety.temple.edu. Temple Police can be called at any time by dialing 215-204-1234.\n\nFor faculty and staff members, our employee assistance program offers support and resources 24/7 online or call 1-888-267-8126.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Griffin\n\nVice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police",

    "content": "Dear Students and Colleagues,\n\nAs you are aware, this week, we have seen several federal actions related to the enrollment of international students at institutions of higher education. The administration has paused all new student visa appointments pending the development of additional review procedures, and the State Department has shared that it will look to revoke visas of students from China, including Hong Kong. This comes less than a week after Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students was threatened.\n\n\n\nThe scope and duration of these actions are unknown at this time, and we are monitoring this situation closely. While Harvard has since won an injunction to protect its international students, these events are the latest examples of the volatile and uncertain environment that institutions of higher education are navigating.\n\nSupporting our international community\n\nAt Temple, we pride ourselves on being a community where all are welcome. Whether you were born five or 5,000 miles away, we welcome and support you.\n\nTo our international students, faculty and staff members, please know that you are a vital part of the Temple family, and we cannot fulfill our mission without you. You are deeply valued, and Temple is stronger because of your contributions and the unique perspectives that you bring to the classroom, community and workplace. Our Office of Global Engagement has been working closely with our students and colleagues across the university to provide information and resources for international members of our community.\n\nThe situation is fluid and will likely continue to evolve in the weeks to come. While we learn more, we are working to identify students who do not have their visas yet and are exploring potential solutions. This could include utilizing our Rome and Japan campuses as well as online courses. We will continue to closely monitor the situation, but rest assured, we are committed to supporting all members of our international community during this difficult time.\n\nI encourage all members of our community to use university resources to take care of themselves. For students, we have resources available through International Student and Scholar Services. For faculty and staff, please remember that our Employee Assistance Program is available 24/7, providing support and resources online or by phone at 1-888-267-8126. Everyone’s emotional and physical well-being is paramount, now and always.\n\nI also want to remind our community that while we have had no reports of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers being on campus, we have an established protocol for working with ICE and CBP agents. Additionally, if there is an instance where any student, faculty or staff member has their visa revoked, we are committed to ensuring that they have access to legal counsel. Over the last few months, we have had five students who had their visas revoked only to have them later restored, and during that time, the university provided resources and ensured that they had appropriate access to their academic studies.\n\nCollaborating through complexity\n\nOver the last several months, we have worked diligently to maneuver through this evolving landscape. We will continue to be thoughtful and intentional in our approach, even as it becomes clear that the complexity of the current moment is likely to further intensify. The Temple community is comprised of individuals with great expertise who care deeply about this institution and its future success. I recognize that we can all benefit from convening a representative group that will help us chart a future path for Temple through these challenges.\n\nFor that reason, in addition to the leadership working group that has been in place since last fall, I will appoint a broad-based advisory group that includes faculty and students and will help Temple navigate the complex environment that we find ourselves in. I will share more details about this advisory group early next month. In the meantime, I want to provide updates on some of the other areas being impacted by actions at the federal level.\n\nResearch update\n\nWe continue to see our research enterprise affected due to federal actions. Thus far, we have received 21 stop-work orders or termination notices for federal grants, which continue to come primarily from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOur Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) has a mechanism in place for assisting those faculty who have been affected to request bridge funding. We also are supporting schools and colleges should they decide to appeal a termination or stop-work order.\n\nWe encourage all members of the Temple research community to continue to take advantage of the Research Resources Webinar Series, which is offered throughout the year and designed to support and empower Temple researchers. An April session focused on understanding Facilities and Administrative costs, and it was attended by more than 80 members of the Temple community.\n\nThe next session will be held Thursday, June 19, from 3 to 4 p.m., and will focus on public access policy. You can register here. OVPR also continues to update this website and established this universitywide Teams site as new federal guidance emerges.\n\nProposed bill\n\nOne of the other items that has been frequently discussed in the news is the potential passage of a wide-ranging federal bill that could have several implications for higher education. Among many other things, the bill could bring changes to the definition of a full-time course load for Pell Grant recipients, and it proposes an increased tax on university endowments.\n\nThe bill has already been passed by the House, and should it be passed by the Senate, it would bring additional uncertainty to the university’s current financial picture, which is already challenged. We will continue to monitor this bill and be sure to keep the university community informed of any potential impacts to Temple.\n\nThank you all for your continued resilience, partnership and commitment to our university during this uncertain time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident",

A BOV is an essential part of a\n\nturbocharged engine, releasing pressure to protect the turbo when the throttle closes. Our design\n\nallows the end user to choose between three unique sound profiles while maintaining the\n\nperformance expected from a quality aftermarket blow-off valve. Whether it’s a deep tone, a sharp\n\nhigh pitch tone or a beat-like sound, users can match their car’s sound to their style without any tools\n\nor mechanical hassle. Built for a 2006–2007 Mazdaspeed6 and the 2020 Polaris RZR Turbo S, our valve is designed for easy installation, long-term durability, and compliance with noise limits. Whether you’re into\n\nperformance tuning or seeking a particular sound combination, the BOV was tested to withstand over\n\n75 psi and extreme temperatures, and its modular design opens up future customization options for\n\ncar enthusiasts.”\n\nAutoSaw\n\nTeam Members: Phoenix Coleman, Michael Koeppen, Austin Williams, Logan Wagner, Nick Jeske\n\n“The AutoSaw is an innovative woodworking solution designed to prioritize safety, efficiency and ease\n\nof use. The automation of the height, angle and fence adjustments allows for faster and more\n\naccurate changes while minimizing operator intervention. Key features of the system include the\n\ntouch screen display and preset functionality, making user input easier for most ages and skill levels.\n\nThe electronics are powered by a microcontroller that interfaces with stepper motors, drivers, limit\n\nswitches and pulley systems to enable precise control. Our team took a stock table saw and\n\nperformed the coding and electronics integration in-house. The design will reduce manual adjustment\n\nerrors, speed up repetitive tasks and provide a safer work environment for users ranging from\n\nhobbyists to professional industrial woodworking applications.”\n\nOff Road Wheelchair Rickshaw\n\nTeam Members: Andrew Lambdin, Avery Richards, Azeem Cossey, Easton Tandecki, Wesley Bauer\n\n“The All-Terrain Wheelchair Rickshaw focuses on improving mobility for wheelchair users in\n\nchallenging environments. Many wheelchairs struggle with rough terrain such as sand, snow, rocks\n\nand steep inclines, especially in outdoor recreational activities or emergency situations. Our goal is to\n\ndesign a universally adaptable attachment that enables caregivers or first responders to more easily\n\nassist individuals in wheelchairs across these difficult terrains. This is particularly important for\n\nAmerican wheelchairs, which vary significantly in frame and footrest design. By addressing the issues of lack of universality and inadequate leverage with a modular, easy-to-attach device, we can improve safety, accessibility, and independence for wheelchair users. While final testing is still underway, FEA simulations, hand calculations and early prototypes have shown promising results. We’re confident this device will help open up new opportunities and destinations that would otherwise be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to for wheelchair users to reach. We believe our project has the potential to enhance quality of life, increase access to outdoor recreation, and provide vital support during\n\nemergency evacuations.",

Your tireless commitment to next-level music and its education has opened doors for many SYS youth and has influenced countless others throughout the region. Your leadership has furthered a culture of excellence, which inspires our students and community to reach further and aim higher.\n\n“Through this program, you have challenged and provided students with opportunities to compete and be adjudicated by experts in their field. For so many, this process has furthered their technical and performance skills. For many, it has even helped prepare them for the rigors of college auditions, thus helping to equip them for future, ongoing musical endeavors. Through your advocacy, Musicfest continues to invite our region’s talented youth to participate through excellent teaching, diligent practice, sustained focus, and higher learning, which all lead to incredible levels of achievement for students. These also nurture, inspire, and prepare them for many areas of life they will embark upon, musical and otherwise.\n\n“Additionally, in your position as the Music Program Director at Eastern Washington University (EWU), your vision and dedication to excellence in music education have significantly impacted the entire region and beyond. Students from SYS are increasingly choosing to attend EWU to make music their lifelong passion. It is evident that your important work at EWU has encouraged our students, provided them with a clear path to success, and inspired them with a sense of excitement for their future. Tomorrow’s music educators are indeed being forged today through your efforts. For this, we are truly grateful.”\n\nFinally, we would like to acknowledge the valued role you have played in our history! We are truly thankful for the time you spent as a board member. We recognize that your recent work as the master of ceremonies for our Diamond Jubilee Celebration in November was thoughtful, entertaining, and demonstrated your depth and breadth of knowledge of our organizational history. We genuinely valued welcoming you to the stage as our ambassador. Now, the conductors of the Spokane Youth Symphony and its Board of Directors want to formally acknowledge our appreciation for all the above by naming you our Honored Guest at our 9th Annual Spring Tea Luncheon & Silent Auction.”",

    "content": "Please join us for an open house to celebrate Ed Byrnes, PhD, as he retires from the School of Social Work.\n\nThe open house runs from noon – 2:30 p.m. on Friday, June 6, inside the second floor lounge in Senior Hall.\n\nRead about Byrnes in this tribute written by Deb Svoboda, graduate program director, associate professor EWU School of Social Work.\n\nDr. Ed Byrnes, Professor of Social Work, is looking forward to learning about birding and gardening and to continuing his lifelong pursuits of skiing and road bicycling with his wife, Janet. After 22 years of academic life at EWU, Ed is retiring from EWU as of September 2025.\n\nEd began his social work career in 1979 on a crisis line at the University of Utah. He began working at the VA hospital as a psych technician that same year, where he progressed into conducting group work and research with his mentor. This work gave him lessons on humility and gratitude. Ed worked graveyard shifts in a group home with youth who were involved in the legal system and child welfare. He worked with adolescents using family therapy and group work over the course of 16 years. He gained lifelong friends through this work and later moved conducting research for the youth mental health organization.\n\nWhile working at the youth mental health organization in Utah, Ed completed his MSW degree and was later recruited into the doctoral program at the University of Utah on a research and teaching fellowship. Ed noted he learned to teach from his seven seasons as a ski instructor at Park West in Utah. With his Ph.D. in 2001, Ed became a research faculty member in the School of Social Work for the Criminal Justice Center at the University of Utah.\n\nAfter meeting the Dean of the EWU School of Social Work, Ed started at the School of Social Work in the fall of 2003. His introduction to EWU came from a group of faculty and staff who were welcoming, supportive, and student focused. At EWU, he learned he really liked teaching and that the “best form of rigor is engagement with students”. Ed served as the BASW Program Director for ten years as well as the assessment coordinator for the school for 17 years. He has served and been a valued contributor on numerous committees for the University, School, and for organizations at the local, state, and national levels. He has stories of rich interactions with students, powerful learning moments from students who taught him to adapt, to slow down in the moment.” Ed added “kindness is what touches students” and “I love that we love and respect our students.”\n\nPost- EWU, Ed will continue his love of research and collaboration with colleagues across the country through intervention research for an alternative program to solitary confinement in correctional institutions. This brings together his love of learning and contributing to research that is meaningful. Ed looks forward to traveling with his wife, Janet, and visiting his children, grandchildren, and friends.\n\nReflecting on his career and life at EWU, Ed says his time at EWU in the classroom and connecting with alumni has been rewarding. Ed still experiences the camaraderie and support in the School and at the University after 22 years, “people have stepped up to help me and I have stepped up for them.”\n\nToday, Ed can say that he has been “extraordinarily lucky, survived things others haven’t, been through a lot, married someone I adore. Eastern gave me a place to develop my teaching values and to develop as a person through providing the space, energy, and feedback to grow. I feel fortunate.”\n\nHis service and contributions to the School, his colleagues, and students are immeasurable. Dr. Ed Byrnes will be missed while we bid him farewell for more adventures.",

    "content": "A team of EWU researchers is quietly and carefully capturing and collaring campus squirrels for a study of this well-loved population of furry mammals.\n\nThe research conducted by Charlotte Milling, assistant professor and wildlife biologist, and her students will be added to the Squirrel-Net consortium, making Eastern’s beloved squirrels if not famous, at least a part of something larger than themselves.\n\nMilling expects to train up to 24 students enrolled in an upper division and graduate-level mammalogy classes to investigate the behavior of live, collared eastern gray squirrels on the Cheney Campus. Students will learn the responsible use of mammals in scientific research, receiving training in institutional animal care and use, current best practice of mammal capture and restraint, marking, tissue (whisker) collection, and tracking via telemetry to ensure well-being, she says.\n\nSince the university touts its squirrel population in recruitment pieces (with perhaps some ‘squirrely’ population numbers), has stuffed squirrels with mini Eastern logo scarves for sale at the Eagle store, and even has a fan-created Instagram account devoted to the beloved mammals, the study is very fitting, Milling says.\n\n“The notoriety and affection students feel for these animals make them a compelling model system for teaching important lessons in mammalogy, responsible wildlife research, and the scientific method,” Milling says.\n\nAdditional project objectives include the following:\n\nStudents will investigate behavioral ecology of eastern gray squirrels by:\n\nEstimating the home range of gray squirrels on the EWU campus and comparing home range size to published estimates from elsewhere in the species range.\n\nConstructing ethograms across varying levels of human disturbance on campus (e.g., weekdays relative to weekends).\n\nMeasuring flight initiation distance (FID) of squirrels across campus in relation to human-provisioning (i.e., trash cans) and human disturbance (i.e., foot traffic).\n\nQuantifying survival.\n\nOther approved behavioral queries.\n\nThe team will catalog data collected from EWU squirrels as part of the squirrel-net.org database, allowing students worldwide to test hypotheses about mammal ecology across large spatial scales. Milling will also share results with the campus when they become available.",

    "content": "Alcohol Awareness Month Resources\n\nDuring Alcohol Awareness Month, held each April, national health organizations encourage you to update your knowledge on the adverse impacts of alcohol misuse and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).\n\nAlcohol misuse is not only one of the leading causes of preventable deaths among Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but it’s also implicated in a range of negative health outcomes with both immediate and long-term effects.\n\nThe CDC defines “heavy drinking” as more than 8 drinks per week for women and more than 15 drinks per week for men. Heavy drinking increases the risk for heart disease, liver disease, stroke and certain types of cancer. Mental health can also be negatively impacted, as higher alcohol consumption is linked with higher rates of depression and anxiety.\n\nThe good news? Decreasing alcohol consumption by just a few drinks per week can lower health-related risks.\n\nIf you are looking to reduce your alcohol consumption, or seek resources for Alcohol Use Disorder, you have options:\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) National Helpline: SAMHSA runs a toll-free hotline you can call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Support is available in English and Spanish by phone 800.662.4357 or online .\n\n. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): If you’re looking for professional counseling to help you change your relationship with alcohol, the NIAAA can help you find therapists, recovery programs and medical care near you. You can also use the free treatment navigator to get started.\n\nto get started. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA): AA offers a 12-step recovery approach. You can see whether this program works for you by checking out one of its many chapters across the country and online .\n\n. Spokane’s Recovery Cafe is a local resource for those seeking community support for substance use. You can learn more here.\n\nOn EWU’s campus, Eagles for Recovery provides support for students seeking to navigate recovery while pursuing their education. While Wellness Wednesday typically focuses on wellness for faculty and staff, Eagles for Recovery is an outlet to which you can direct students who may be struggling.\n\n“Alcohol use is something all college campuses face,” says Samantha Auble, EWU’s prevention and recovery center coordinator. “We do see this on EWU’s campus.”\n\nThe Eagles for Recovery lounge is located in Showalter 118. It hosts weekly drop-in hours for students who are actively in recovery, curious about recovery or looking for a place to build community, Auble says.\n\n“We also offer one-to-one recovery coaching for those who need to talk with a certified coach about their addiction, and we table around campus providing education and resources,” says Auble. “Faculty and staff can help struggling students by having them look at the Eagles for Recovery website, walking them to the lounge or having them email recovery@ewu.edu to schedule an appointment.”\n\nEagles for Recovery also posts about educational opportunities and events on their Instagram page: @eaglesforrecovery.\n\nWellness News and Resources",

    "content": "EWU Executive Leadership Update\n\nMarch 2025\n\nPresident’s Update\n\nAs we get ready to begin spring quarter, I want to thank you for the energy, care, and commitment you continue to bring to Eastern. Your work contributes to our success at every level, and it doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\nWith students returning to class, this is a particularly important time to help them feel supported and encouraged. Even small gestures like checking in, helping them find a new class location, or offering an extra word of support can go a long way in helping students feel like they belong here.\n\nMany of you are aware of the recent news out of the Department of Education about staff reductions and possible shifting of responsibilities, especially related to federal student aid, to other government agencies. The university is closely tracking changes and assessing how any new policies or developments might impact our university or our students. These are complex issues, and I want you to know that we are paying close attention. At this time, however, we have not received any official guidance or information that would change our current processes.\n\nThis week, I had the opportunity to join a group of our students and campus representatives for a two-day immersive visit to Universal Pictures in Los Angeles. Proud EWU alumni Jim Orr ’83, president for domestic theatrical distribution at NBCUniversal, facilitated meetings with creative strategists and marketing executives to filmmakers and producers, who generously shared their insights on everything from theatrical research and agency representation to the art of storytelling and inclusive production practices. Highlights included conversations with director Jon M. Chu (Wicked) , as well as a powerful discussion on the No Drama initiative, which is expanding opportunities for underrepresented voices in film. This experience was incredible and connected our students to real-world environments as they prepare for their careers. An immense thank you to Dr. Pete Porter for organizing this amazing opportunity for our students!\n\nAs commencement approaches, I want to personally invite staff to sign up as volunteers! Being part of this celebration is an uplifting reminder of why we do what we do, and our graduates are always grateful to see so many familiar EWU faces as they get ready to cross that stage into the next chapter of their lives.\n\nFinally, this month’s Eagle 1 newsletter features some wonderful stories about the people and programs that make EWU so special. I encourage you to take a moment to read more about the great work happening across our campus community.\n\nAdministrative Updates\n\nAcademic Affairs – Provost & Vice President Jonathan Anderson\n\nEastern Washington University has successfully fulfilled three of five recommended improvements from its accreditor, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). At its January 2025 meeting, NWCCU accepted Eastern’s Ad Hoc report and peer review findings, confirming the university met recommendations one, three, and four. This achievement keeps EWU on track in the reaffirmation process, with remaining recommendations scheduled for review in spring 2026. Thank you to the campus community, particularly Jake Morrison and the Institutional Effectiveness office, for their leadership. Read the full story.\n\nRecently, the Degree Completion Team asked students – through the EWU AI chatbot, SwoopBot – to reflect on their experiences at EWU and share if someone on campus had a meaningful impact on their time here this year. We received a wealth of heartfelt responses recognizing faculty and staff. Seeing students recognize and appreciate faculty and staff efforts is a testament to the impact you all are making. The Degree Completion Team has been reaching out individually to those who received special notes of gratitude to share these messages from students, so be on the lookout!\n\nThe Provost’s Office invites applications for Special Assistant to the Provost for General Education, a role providing leadership in advancing EWU’s General Education program. The position has been reviewed and supported by the General Education Committee (GEC) and includes 20 credits of reassigned time per year and 5 credits in summer. Faculty with General Education teaching experience are encouraged to apply by April 15. Contact provost@ewu.edu with any questions.\n\nGet ready for Something Rotten!, the musical comedy directed by Jeff Sanders, coming to the EWU stage with performances to run April 4, 5, 11, and 12 and 7:30 p.m.; April 6 at 2:00 p.m.; and April 10 at 5:00 p.m.. Set in the 1590s, the show follows brothers Nick and Nigel Bottom as they try to outshine Shakespeare by creating the world’s first musical—complete with singing, dancing, and outrageous antics. You can purchase tickets here!\n\nThank you for your thoughtful work making modifications to courses and programs over the past year. Your efforts strengthen our academic offerings and enhance the student experience. I also want to extend my sincere thanks to the members of the Course and Program Approval Committees (CPAC) and the Program Review Committee (PRC) for their time and expertise. As these changes take effect, please work with Associate Deans to ensure students are informed about changes that affect them. Communication can help address any questions they may have and serves as a valuable opportunity to engage with your majors and advisees.\n\nThank you to Ernestine Jim and Evanlene Melting Tallow for collaborating with Rise Above, a non-profit organization based in Spokane. In partnership with Levi Horn, the American Indian Studies program hosted two groups of students from Rise Above, providing them with a tour of the American Indian Studies program space and a discussion about dreams and goals. The participants were part of the Spokane TANF 477 program, which offers after-school support, including homework assistance and tutoring. After the presentation, all students, along with Rise Above staff, were invited to attend the EWU Women’s Basketball game on Monday, March 3, where outstanding academic achievements were recognized at halftime. I appreciate the American Indian Studies program’s efforts to engage with our community and highlight the opportunities that higher education can provide.\n\nEastern Washington Area Health Education Center (EWAHEC) Director Jenna McDonald will deliver the opening and closing keynote addresses at the Northwest Rural Health Conference in Spokane from March 24-26.

They spoke on a panel, Apprenticeship to Baccalaureate and Beyond, highlighting EWU’s partnership with the SEIU Healthcare Training Fund to support apprenticeship graduates in earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees. CCBA recognized their work as a Promising Practice and invited them to present and be honored at the next national conference.\n\nEastern Washington University has been awarded a grant to participate in the Holistic Credit Mobility Acceleration cohort, an initiative led by Ithaka S+R and Complete College America that includes 11 other higher education organizations from across the nation. The goal is to develop flexible pathways for students transferring credits from multiple sources.\n\nLed by the innovative efforts of Dr. Gina Petrie, PCE is launching a new Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) Certificate consisting of nine mobile-friendly, 3-week courses, specifically designed for community members looking to teach English overseas, providing essential skills in language instruction, assessment, cultural navigation, and international job seeking.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nEastern Washington University’s Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students are making a difference in community healthcare! Five students from the DPT Class of 2025 recently participated in the Union Gospel Mission free medical clinic, gaining hands-on experience while providing essential care to underserved populations. This opportunity is part of their integrated clinical experiences (ICE) during their second year, coordinated by our Director of Clinical Education, Cyndi Robinson. These experiences, along with their full-time clinical education in year three, prepare our students to be compassionate and skilled healthcare professionals. Read more about their work here.\n\nCongratulations to Dr. Christian Hansen from the Department of Mathematics who contributed two chapters to a new book, Realizing Complex Integrated Systems.\n\nDr. Christi Harter (AVP PCE) along with Dr. Amanda Welsh from Northeastern presented their research on learning and employment records (LERs) at the 1EdTech Digital Credentials Summit, a nationally recognized event where education leaders, employers, and edtech innovators collaborate to create better pathways for learners through digital credentials. Harter also published Empowering the Individual Through LERs in The Evolllution.\n\nOur Cyberdefenders are advancing to the NCAE National Championships for the fourth year in a row after a commanding performance at the semifinals! Our top team defeated teams from 11 challengers including teams from the University of Florida, BYU, Sam Houston State, University of Southern Utah, and others. For the first time EWU had enough students to field a second full team of mostly first and second-year students. EWU Team 2 also finished near the top of the standings! Congratulations to Stu Steiner, Tony Espinoza, and the talented students they have been mentoring!\n\nExecutive Director of Institutional Effectiveness, Jake Morrison, and Associate Director of Assessment, Tiffany Jones, have been selected for Cohort Seven of the prestigious NWCCU Mission Fulfillment & Sustainability Fellowship. This highly competitive fellowship brings together higher education leaders from across the region to engage in a year-long exploration of institutional effectiveness, strategic planning, and continuous improvement. Supported by a distinguished faculty that includes national experts such as Peter Ewell, Jillian Kinzie, Adrianna Kezar, and Natasha Jankowski, the fellowship will provide valuable opportunities for learning, collaboration, and innovation. Dr. Morrison and Dr. Jones’ participation will contribute meaningfully to EWU’s ongoing efforts to advance mission fulfillment and sustainability across the institution.\n\nEastern Washington University is proud to be among the inaugural academic institutions participating in the newly launched National Outdoor Recreation Workforce Consortium, a partnership between the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable (ORR) and West Virginia University’s Brad and Alys Smith Outdoor Economic Development Collaborative. This national effort brings together leading higher education institutions and outdoor recreation industry partners to address workforce development needs in the $1.2 trillion outdoor economy. The Consortium will focus on collaboration, education, and research to create a new outdoor career competency taxonomy and support the development of a skilled, future-ready workforce.\n\nBusiness & Finance – Vice President Mary Voves\n\nAnnika Scharosch, Associate Vice President, is leading a workgroup of leaders across campus to collaborate in sharing information and resources regarding Executive Orders, Dear Colleague Letters, and executive enforcement actions. The workgroup includes representatives from the Office of Grants and Research Development, JLR Multicultural Center, Pride Center, Global Studies, Enrollment Services, Human Resources, Marketing and Communications, and the President’s Office.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the ongoing budget discussions and proposals at the state level.

In addition to bringing a welcomed energy to the division, these students are gaining a better understanding of the connection between their academic programs and our trades, creating a solid foundation for future careers. This program is in direct alignment with EWU’s polytechnic approach, offering paid opportunities and a flexible schedule that prioritizes academic achievement all while gaining life skills that will carry with them long after their time here.

    "content": "Eastern Washington University is progressing in the reaffirmation process with its accreditor. At its January 28-31, 2025 meeting, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) found Eastern has successfully fulfilled three of five recommended improvements, specifically accomplishing numbers one, three and four of the list included below.\n\nNWCCU issued the five recommendations back in January 2022. Of those, three were scheduled for review in this cycle, so Eastern remains on track.\n\nThese recommendations were reviewed in a Fall 2024 Ad Hoc report and a subsequent peer review visit. After reviewing EWU’s submission and the evaluation team’s findings, NWCCU formally accepted Eastern’s report and confirmed that our university fulfilled recommendations one, three, and four during its January 2025 meeting.\n\nProvost Jonathan Anderson expressed his appreciation to members of the EWU community who contributed to this successful effort.\n\n“This achievement reflects the hard work and dedication of our entire institution,” Anderson says. “I want to extend my gratitude to Jake Morrison and the Institutional Effectiveness office for their leadership in coordinating our efforts and response to NWCCU.”\n\nA planned mid-cycle visit to review the university’s fulfillment of recommendations No. 2 and 5 has been rescheduled from spring 2025 to spring 2026, Anderson says.\n\nThe university will then submit a second report demonstrating progress in fulfilling those remaining two recommendations, and a peer evaluation team will make a site-visit to Eastern.\n\nHere are NWCCU’s recommendations:\n\nDemonstrate a continuous process to assess institutional effectiveness relative to the institution’s priorities. This includes a system by which data is collected, reviewed, used to inform decision making, and utilized for allocating resources across the entire institution in a cohesive manner. Make further progress in our system of assessment institution-wide to evaluate the quality of learning in our programs and improve instructional programs. This is to be done by ensuring a clear path through all the assessment processes and closing the loop by using assessment results as input into resource allocation processes. Make publicly available select disaggregated indicators of student achievement that are clearly and systematically integrated into the assessment of institutional effectiveness. Review the diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in academic units, Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and Student Affairs with a goal to reduce redundancy and increase support designed to close equity gaps. Provide information verifying required course sequences and projected timelines to completion based on normal student progress and frequency of course offerings.\n\nHere are NWCCU’s recommendations from Feb. 27, 2023. You can review all NWCCU accreditation documents by visiting our Accreditation Documents Repository.",

    "content": "EWU Police Chief Jewell Day sent the following helpful tips to campus on March 4, 2025:\n\nDear Campus Community,\n\nThere have been several reports of vehicle break-ins on the EWU campus and in the city of Cheney. EWU police continue to actively investigate the incidents that have occurred on campus. Below are some tips that could prove to be helpful in preventing vehicle prowls:\n\nSecure Your Vehicle\n\nRoll your car windows up all the way and engage the car alarm, but do not depend on it as the only way to deter a thief. A car thief can break into your car and be out in about 30 seconds, fast enough that an alarm doesn’t scare most of them away.\n\nKeep Your Vehicle Tidy\n\nThieves like to window shop! Avoid leaving anything visible in the car. Almost any item that’s visible from the outside – even if you think it is worthless – could be seen as valuable to a thief. Your spare change, sunglasses, even an empty bag (a thief may think there is something inside the bag) could be valuable in the mind of a thief.\n\nConceal All Proof\n\nStow your electronics and accessories well out of sight, or just take it along with you. The proof alone might be enough to pique the interest of thieves, including items such as power cords, adapters, and GPS windshield suction-cup mounts. If you remove the suction cup, make sure to wipe the ring off the windshield; it’s a dead giveaway that you own a GPS.\n\nStash Before You Park\n\nGet in the habit of putting items you want hidden in the trunk of your car before you arrive at your destination. Thieves will linger in busy parking lots looking for you to stash your valuable items.\n\nPark Smart\n\nPark in a busy, well-lit area and avoid concealment from larger vehicles, fences, or foliage. Avoid parking in isolated and poorly lit areas.\n\nReport Break-Ins\n\nIf you see a break-in in progress, call 911 immediately! Provide the 911 dispatcher with as much information as possible, such as:\n\nLocation – Provide an address, block number, or specific location in a parking lot.\n\nDescription of the suspect – Provide as much information as you can, i.e. sex, race, age, height, weight, hair color and length, color and length of facial hair, colors and style of clothing, and identifying marks such as tattoos and piercings.\n\nDirection – If the suspect flees, give the direction of travel. If they flee on a bicycle or in a vehicle, describe the color, make, model, and license plate number, if it is safe to do so!\n\nIf you have information regarding the recent break-ins, or have safety concerns, please contact the EWU Police Department and speak to either myself or my staff who are dedicated to serving our community.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nChief Jay Day\n\nJewell Day | AVP for Public Safety/Chief of Police\n\nEWU Police Department\n\n101 Red Barn ▪ 609 W 7th St ▪ Cheney, WA 99004\n\n509.359.6924 ▪ jday@ewu.edu",

    "content": "Email message sent to CAHSS faculty and staff by Provost Jonathan Anderson on Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nDr. Michelle DenBeste to lead the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nI am delighted to share that Dr. Michelle DenBeste has verbally agreed to become the next Dean of the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences. Dr. DenBeste will begin her new role on July 1, 2025.\n\nDr. DenBeste earned a B.A. in Russian and East European Studies from the University of Washington. She went on to earn both her M.A. and Ph.D. in History from Southern Illinois University. She has a record of publications on women in Russian history and has taught courses as a tenured faculty member on topics such as 20th Century Europe, the Holocaust, 20th Century Russian Women, Women in World History, Russian Civilization, and Revolutions in World History (including the French Revolution). Dr. DenBeste also has vast experience in leading and managing grants, having served as PI/Co-PI and grant-writer for several years on a series of national grants, some of which included Complete College America Intermediaries for Scale Regional Grant (2023), The United States Department of Education Presidential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics Program (2018-2022), and Teaching American History Grants (2005-2012). She has also led and taught several study abroad trips (to St. Petersburg, Moscow, London, and Prague), and participated as an Administrative Fulbright Scholar to France in 2022.\n\nDr. DenBeste’s leadership experiences are commendable. She served as Dean of the College of Social Sciences at California State University, Fresno for five years before serving as Provost and Vice President of Central Washington University from 2020-2023. She is currently serving as Interim Dean of the Hasan School of Business at Colorado State University, Pueblo. Some major accomplishments throughout her professional career include reorganizing a university-wide advising structure, creating an Office of Undergraduate Studies, creating a Provost Faculty Fellows program, developing an equity focused summer high impact practices institute for faculty, diversifying hiring at all levels (faculty, staff, and administration), collaboratively drafting a new strategic plan and mission statement at the college level, overseeing the implementation of a new institute for leadership and public policy, and developing a student leadership council. In addition to Dr. DenBeste’s notable academic service, she has a history of community service wherever she goes.\n\nDuring her campus visit, Dr. DenBeste impressed many with her relevant experience and skills, the concrete examples she was able to provide, and the level of preparedness she showcased throughout the interview process. Feedback from the campus community highlighted her experience with a first-gen student population like that of EWU, awareness of the particular concerns of a regional comprehensive university in Washington State, and her ability to deal with difficult situations at a very high level based on her large breadth of experience in higher education leadership roles like dean and provost.\n\nFeedback from various stakeholders, including chairs, deans, CAHSS faculty and staff, and President McMahan, confirmed that Dr. DenBeste is the right leader for the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences at EWU. Please join me in congratulating and welcoming her to our community.\n\nI would like to thank the search advisory committee for their dedication:\n\n• Martha Raske, Committee Chair\n\n• Ann Le Bar, Professor, Department of History, Anthropology, and Modern Languages & Literatures\n\n• Jane Ellsworth, Professor, Department of Fine & Performing Arts\n\n• Kass Kebede, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology & Justice Studies\n\n• Kevin Decker, Professor, Department of English & Philosophy\n\n• Kevin Pirch, Professor, Department of Political Science & Public Policy\n\n• Margo Hill, Associate Professor, American Indian Studies Program & Urban and Regional Planning\n\n• Nicholas Larsen, Professor, Department of Economics\n\n• Justin Otto, Professor, School of Libraries\n\n• Freda Gandy, Director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Family Outreach Center (Spokane)\n\nFinally, I extend my deepest gratitude to Interim Dean Florian Preisig for assuming the interim Dean role this past year. His calm and steady leadership, coupled with his fair and balanced approach, has been instrumental in guiding CAHSS these past two years.\n\nIn gratitude,\n\n-Jon\n\nJonathan W. Anderson, PhD, Provost and VP for Academic Affairs, professor, School of Psychology",

These proposals will remain open for comment until January 31st. You may submit your comments on the policy website or by attending a public hearing on Friday, January 31st at 12:00 p.m. in Tawanka 215A. If you need an accommodation to attend the hearing, please contact me at least three days prior to the hearing.\n\nEWU Policy 101-01: University Organization Updates the policy language to reflect changes to EWU’s mission, vision, and values previously approved by the Board of Trustees EWU Policy 204-01: Space Utilization Adds a provision indicating the allocation and utilization of space on campus must prioritize the student experience, facilitate easy access to services, and support the holistic journey of students\n\nUpdates membership of the Space Planning and Advisory Committee\n\nSimplifies the space request process\n\nExcludes space at the Catalyst and SIERR buildings from the policy EWU Policy 401-02: Additional or Outside Compensated Work Adds language indicating an EWU employee may not take on additional work at EWU if the combination of their regular job and additional work exceeds 134% FTE during any term of the academic year. For example, if the additional employment is teaching and the employee is already employed in another capacity by the university on a full-time basis, the teaching may not exceed 5 quarter credits or 3 semester credits. Exceptions may be approved by an employee’s regular direct supervisor and vice president. This addition is consistent with similar language regarding overload in the collective bargaining agreement for faculty.\n\nPolicies Under Initial Review\n\nThe following policies are currently under review and proposed changes may be presented to the Board of Trustees for first read in February. Once these proposed changes are presented to the Board of Trustees for initial review, they will be sent to all EWU employees and open to public comment before being submitted to the Board of Trustees for approval in May.\n\nEWU Policy 301-01: Academic Organization\n\nEWU Policy 302-05: Integrity in Research\n\nEWU Policy 406-01: Exempt Employment\n\nEWU Policy 407-01: Temporary Employment\n\nWAC 172-10-080: Costs of Public Records\n\nIf you have any questions about the policy process or EWU policies, please feel free to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnnika Scharosch, J.D.\n\nAssoc.

Pickleball also promotes overall physical wellness, and can help you reach the 150 minutes of physical activity per week recommended by the American Heart Association.\n\nIt’s free to play, and there’s loaner gear, so what are you waiting for?

    "content": "Hello everyone – As June begins, our Washington State Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is offering the following resources to support you and your family:\n\nEAP Events and Webinars\n\nThis month, the Washington State EAP is excited to share our expanded roster of *live* events and webinars. We hope that you will be able to join us for the following events:\n\nNavigating Change in Challenging Times\n\nIn our ever-changing world, learning how to navigate change is an essential skill—one that can be developed. In this webinar we’ll talk about the impact of change, actions you can take to navigate change based on your unique response to stress, and resources available to support you.\n\nMonday, June 24 | 3-4 p.m.\n\nLeading the Human Side of Change\n\nIn this presentation leaders will understand their own response to change and how this impacts their ability to lead others through the change process; gain a better understanding of the impact of change on employees; learn leadership strategies that will support their team through change; begin to develop a plan to support their team; earn what resources are available to support leaders and teams through change.\n\nThursday, June 13 | 3:30-4:30 p.m. and Friday, June 28 | 3:30–4:30 p.m.\n\nEAP Orientation for Supervisors, Leaders, and HR Professionals\n\nThis is a new monthly EAP orientation with a focus on the EAP benefits available to supervisors,\n\nleaders, and HR professionals. Tuesday, June 25 | 9-9:30 a.m.\n\nEAP Orientation to the Employee Assistance Program\n\nLearn about all the EAP offers through a live 30-minute EAP Orientation webinar. Tuesday, June 11 | 11– 11:30 a.m.\n\nCan’t attend the live June webinars? Check out future dates. In addition, EAP offers on demand webinars on a variety of subjects, including EAP Orientation, depression and anxiety relating to stress, emotional intelligence, and more.\n\nWork/Life\n\nIn June, the EAP Work/Life site is offering tools and resources about the basics of living well so you can explore self-care strategies to improve physical health, nurture mental wellbeing, foster positive relationships, and adopt healthy habits. Get started by viewing this month’s on-demand seminar, “Living Well 365 – Igniting Motivation for a Fulfilling Life” – it’s available beginning Tuesday, June 18th through the Work/Life site: just login with your Organization Code, EWU .\n\nMonthly Resources\n\nAs we celebrate Loving Day, Pride Month, and Juneteenth in June, it’s essential to recognize the interconnected themes of love, freedom, and equality that unite these commemorations. Loving Day, observed on June 12, honors the 1967 Supreme Court decision in Loving v. Virginia, which struck down laws banning interracial marriage, affirming the fundamental right to marry regardless of race. Pride Month, celebrated throughout June, highlights the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights and commemorates the Stonewall Riots of 1969, which ignited the modern gay rights movement. Juneteenth, observed on June 19, marks the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in 1865, symbolizing a significant milestone in the long struggle for racial equality in the United States. Each of these observances reflects a crucial victory against discrimination and the persistent efforts to achieve justice and equality for all.\n\nRecognizing Loving Day, Pride Month, and Juneteenth is vital as they collectively underscore the importance of celebrating diversity and promoting inclusion in our society. By honoring these days, we acknowledge the progress made and the work that still lies ahead in combating racism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice. These commemorations remind us of the resilience and courage of those who fought for their rights and the ongoing necessity to uphold and protect those hard-won freedoms. Through education, advocacy, and community engagement, we can continue to build a more equitable and loving world where everyone is free to be their true selves and live without fear of discrimination.\n\nArticles\n\n\n\nWork:\n\nPersonal Relationships:\n\nFamily Connection:\n\n**f you’re struggling, or looking for some support, guidance, or useful resources, please know that our EAP is here for you — don’t hesitate to reach out: 1.877.313.4455 or online.",

    "content": "The Work Ahead: Designing a More Integrated, More Resilient New School\n\nA Message from Joel Towers, President and University Professor\n\n“The political and social problems forced upon the country by the economic development of the past twenty-five years call for a new type of leadership in every field of American life.”\n\nThe opening sentence of the 1918 mission statement by the “organization committee” that imagined The New School is as relevant as ever. And it is the spirit and charge of this mission that sets the stage for the work we now need to advance to shape The New School’s future. Innovation and progressive change at The New School have always been propelled by the fundamental question: how can we shape the university to address the issues of our time? Today, as we look back over the past 25 years, the key issues calling out for educational reform to inspire new leadership are climate change, threats to democracy, shaping cities and urban life for the future, and harnessing the power of technology for social good. Progressive education today must engage these challenges.\n\nGrounded by our founding mission and guided by our commitment to our students, I am writing today to share the context and a plan for the work ahead to align structure and budget so that The New School can become more resilient for the long term.\n\nOptimizing our Structure\n\nPositioning The New School for the current times and the future has always challenged us to think differently about our organizational structure. We have continually made strides to open up pathways to cross-disciplinary collaboration and movement to empower innovation.\n\nOver the past year, we have had ongoing conversations about the university’s structure in small group settings, among the academic leadership, and with faculty across the university, including, most recently, at the town hall hosted by the University Faculty Senate that specifically addressed structural changes for the Schools of Public Engagement. That effort – the “Academic Core” project – was a major focus this year. The work was challenging, and the outcomes may be imperfect, but they represent a significant effort to improve program alignment and create space for greater collaboration, equity, and flexibility. I am deeply appreciative of everyone who has been involved in this planning, implementation, and feedback. Now we need to use that momentum to look more comprehensively at the whole university with an eye toward potential structural shifts aligned with broader aspirations.\n\nAddressing Financial Challenges\n\nThe university’s financial position provides important context and makes clear the need for change. The recent Community Budget Presentations provided straightforward information about the realities of The New School’s financial position. If you missed the presentations, I encourage you to watch the recorded session. The headline is that the university faces a $31.3 million deficit budget in fiscal year 2026, following two previous years of similar deficits. It is evident that this deficit is structural and must be addressed. This context informs the 2024 strategic plan presented to me at the beginning of my presidency as that work reflected, in part, the financial presentations of February 2024 and the prospect of a balanced budget. Nonetheless, the strategic plan offers critical insight and priorities for the future of The New School that will guide our work going forward.\n\nThe Board approved the deficit budget for FY 2026 with the mandate that we create a plan to reverse the deficit over the next several years. The expectation is that our budget outlook will improve by the end of FY 2026 and, in the following years, return to a balanced budget and, eventually, surpluses.\n\nThe multi-faceted efforts already underway include a holistic strategy for strengthening enrollment and retention and a comprehensive assessment of our real estate and space use, as you’ve heard in recent messages from Francisco Pineda. We will actively pursue new external funding sources, including philanthropy and grants. Drawing on the recommendations from the Strategic Planning Report, we will endeavor to both stabilize the university’s financial health and achieve equity by taking a progressive view toward employee compensation, while also being more disciplined in reviewing all vacant and proposed new positions and evaluating each against our strategic goals, operational needs, and financial realities.\n\nThe Work This Summer\n\nTo intentionally advance and integrate the work on structure and budget this summer, I will be establishing working groups focused on Academics, Finance, Space, Administrative structure, and Communications. These working groups will include faculty as well as academic, operational, and administrative leaders and will be charged with evaluating options and making recommendations. A follow-up communication will share more about the composition and charge for the working groups. What I want to stress at the outset are several guiding principles:\n\nFirst, all this work will center our foundational commitments to our students and their education and to advancing research, scholarship, and creative practice. Second, this work will build upon existing planning efforts, including the Academic Core work and the Strategic Planning process, allowing for both continuity and reinvention. Third, the work will proceed with a commitment to open and regular communication.\n\nThe recommendations from the summer working groups will be shared with the university community and the Board of Trustees in the fall and will become an integrated plan that will lay out a structure and budget framework in service to our mission and vision. This plan will inform how we prioritize efforts and resource allocation in the years to come.\n\nThank you for your interest, engagement, and leadership in this work, in whatever form that might take, and for your faith in the purpose of higher education, the mission of The New School, and our distinctive approach to higher education that anticipates the future.",

    "content": "Congratulations to the Class of 2025\n\nA Message from Joel Towers, President and University Professor\n\nCommencement is here!\n\nOver the last few days, in dozens of recognition ceremonies across the campus, students and their families and friends have celebrated the extraordinary achievement that is graduation. Students selected by their colleges, invited guests, deans, department chairs, program directors, and faculty have offered reflections on the meaning of their specific areas of study, this class of graduates, and the importance of their work in our times. Students’ names have been called, they have walked across stages, and they have been honored by loved ones, together with the faculty and staff closest to their programs. And in an exuberant outpouring of talent, energy, scholarship, and creativity, there have been performances, exhibitions, readings, presentations, and final reviews that have demonstrated students’ hard work, probing questions, and passionate embrace of their studies and the world. It has been a whirlwind of brilliance and emotion. I have crisscrossed the campus seeking to experience it all in what sometimes felt like hundreds of events all scheduled at the same time. Occasionally, I would just pause and let it all wash over me because to be in this community, in all its splendor and cacophony, is an inspiration and a joy of unparalleled proportion. I am certain the Class of 2025 will transform the future.\n\n‌Today it all comes to a crescendo when we gather as one university community for commencement and the conferral of degrees. It is a moment of deep celebration—a chance to step back from the everyday and mark this inflection point in the lives of the Class of 2025, and in the life of The New School. Before all the tears of joy, I want to take this moment to congratulate the graduates. You inspire me. I also want to thank all the faculty and staff for a remarkable year. Your dedication to our core mission of education, research, scholarship, and creative practice have been our North Star.\n\n‌See you all in Brooklyn in full regalia!",

It confirmed, what we had hoped, which is that the four students I wrote to you about last week who had previously had their SEVIS records terminated have now had their records restored as part of a broad-based action by the federal government in response to legal challenges across the country.\n\nOur ISSS staff immediately notified the impacted students and, along with our college leadership, are working with them to ensure the successful completion of their courses and the semester. We continue to encourage our international students and scholars to visit the ISSS webpage for important updates, travel guidance, and other resources—and for all members of our community to take advantage of the support and resources offered by the university.\n\nOn behalf of the whole university community, I am deeply relieved that all of our students can now complete the semester and continue their studies. That said, we will remain vigilant. Unfounded actions, like these SEVIS terminations, pose an unacceptable threat to the university. We will continue to work tirelessly to preserve and protect a campus welcoming to all students from around the world and across the country. We will stand up for freedom of speech, the pursuit of learning, tolerance, a commitment to our shared humanity, and a university where all can create extraordinary works of art, design, performance, and scholarship free from discrimination.",

    "content": "An Update on How We Are Supporting Our Community\n\nA Message from Joel Towers, President and University Professor\n\nDear Students, Faculty, and Staff,\n\nI am writing today to inform you that four international New School students recently had their visas revoked. This action appears unrelated to any activity on our campus. The university had no prior knowledge of, or participation in these revocations. We learned about them through our regular daily review of international student visa status. Members of our International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) immediately reached out to the students whose visas had been revoked. Prior to our outreach, they were unaware of the change in their visa status. We have been providing the students regular counseling and support, connections to legal representation, pathways to complete the semester, and advocacy on their behalf at the federal level. We continue to hope their visas will be reinstated but are fully prepared to support them if they are not.\n\nIt is important to be very clear. The actions the federal government is taking against universities are unprecedented. They threaten values central to The New School’s mission, including the safety and security of our community members who are not U.S. citizens, academic freedom and freedom of expression and inquiry, research and financial aid, and our ability to cultivate a diverse and inclusive community. It remains unclear how federal directives on higher education will be implemented—especially as a number of those directives continue to face legal challenges. Each of us in university leadership is working with colleagues at other universities and beyond to ensure collaboration in the defense of higher education. Whatever the future presents, we will not retreat from the mission of higher education.\n\nBecause the government’s claims often include Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, let me reiterate what I have said about that landmark legislation in my earliest messages to The New School. We have a deep and abiding commitment to a university free of discrimination, antisemitism, racism, or hate of any kind. They are intolerable and corrode the character of our learning environment. Title VI protections against discrimination and academic freedom reinforce each other. They each require care and understanding. Nothing less is sufficient to our charge.\n\nPlease know that wherever you are from, and whomever you love, we embrace who you are and are thankful that you are part of The New School community. Your experiences, contributions, voices, and perspectives enrich our campus immeasurably. To learn is to grow. It requires an expanding of your horizons not a narrowing. Sometimes that can be unsettling and hard. Education is not easy, but its rewards are everywhere in evidence. From a growing economy to the next generation of transformative talent, universities contribute to a vibrant democracy full of new ideas, knowledge, innovation, and creativity. Universities are critical to the future. Education and an abiding commitment to our shared humanity are what make our work possible.\n\nPlease read below for updates on how we are continuing to support our community.\n\n—–\n\n‌Supporting Our Community\n\nOur Guiding Principles\n\nWe will continue to hold paramount the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff.\n\nWe will defend academic freedom and the rights of individuals to engage in research, creative pursuits, and the exploration and interrogation of new ideas and perspectives without fear of punishment or retribution.\n\nWe will continue to foster a diverse and equitable community, recognizing that engaging with people who hold different ideas, identities, and backgrounds advances academic excellence, enriches our experiences, and broadens our perspectives.\n\nHow We Are Responding to Federal Directives\n\nWe are working on a number of fronts to anticipate, plan for, and react to federal actions in order to minimize disruption and harm to our community. On campus, those efforts include establishing a campus-wide working group to assess the recent federal actions, take steps to address potential impacts to our university, and support members of our community who are directly affected. This work includes informing students, faculty, and staff members of their rights in various situations—particularly when interacting with authorities, understanding digital privacy, or in legal matters—and sharing information on the university’s protocols for responding to law enforcement or immigration officials seeking information or access to campus.\n\nWe are also advocating for The New School and higher education more broadly and are in close contact with state and federal higher education associations and other advocacy groups. In addition, several of us have attended meetings in Washington, D.C. with other university leaders and federal lawmakers to discuss the impact of the actions and issues raised so far, advocate for our institutions and communities, and begin planning for what might come next.\n\nUpdate on International Student Visa Revocations\n\nOver the past several weeks, according to various news outlets, approximately 1500 international students on F-1 or J-1 status at universities across the nation have had their visas revoked and Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) status terminated by the federal government. We always carefully monitor student visa records and have increased our regular scans to several times per day.\n\nRecently we learned that the Federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) has terminated the status of four New School students. Our Office of International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) notified the impacted students immediately and has been working closely with them on many fronts.\n\nISSS staff are available to offer support and resources to F-1 and J-1 international students or faculty scholars who may have questions. We encourage you to immediately notify ISSS of any pressing concerns, and an advisor will reach out to set up a same-day appointment. Please visit the ISSS web page for important updates, current travel guidance, and other resources. We hope you will read our FAQ for answers to visa and travel questions.\n\nGuidance for Faculty and Staff on Updated Federal Registration Requirements for Foreign Nationals\n\nEffective April 11, 2025, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued an Interim Final Rule that reinforces and updates the longstanding requirement for noncitizens to register with the federal government and carry proof of registration at all times. The rule also establishes new penalties for noncompliance. Our Human Resources team has shared guidance with faculty and staff who may be impacted by this change to make sure they are aware of the updated rule and can take any necessary steps to ensure compliance.\n\nThere are numerous resources on campus available to our faculty and staff, including free confidential legal consultations through the university’s Employee Assistance Program. If you have any questions about how this change might affect you or need additional guidance, please contact the HR team at HRHelp@newschool.edu.\n\nFederal Research Funding\n\nMany of you have raised concerns about how reliance on federal funding is affecting decision-making on our campus, as we learn about developments at other institutions. To the extent that is happening, the affected schools are almost exclusively large research universities, which are often heavily reliant on federal funding. In comparison, The New School has a diverse funding portfolio for research and other sponsored projects that is led by funding from private foundations, internal research funding, and then federal funding. While much of the research carried out at the university is not directly supported by federal research funding, some funding has been rescinded, and we are working to support that scholarship.\n\nThe university will continue to offer additional opportunities for research support such as The New School Student Research Award and the Faculty Research Fund; General Research Funds and Student Research Assistant Funds for full-time faculty; and several other college-based funds and initiatives for students, faculty, and staff. We will also continue to actively engage with private foundations and other sources of funding to support critical research at the university.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThis is an unsettling time and we wish we could offer more certainty as to how federal actions will affect The New School in the days and weeks ahead. Please be assured that we will continue to update the community as new information is available. In the meantime, count on our steadfast commitment to defending our academic mission and supporting members of our community.\n\nWe encourage you to take advantage of the support and resources offered by the university.",

    "content": "A Message from President Towers: Welcoming Susan Sawyer, Senior Vice President, Chief of Staff to the President, and Special Counsel\n\nI am pleased to share that Susan Sawyer will rejoin The New School as Senior Vice President, Chief of Staff, and Special Counsel. She will serve as a key member of my senior administration, managing daily operations, providing administrative oversight, overseeing institutional initiatives, and enhancing collaboration and communication with the leadership team and the broader university community. Susan will also assume the responsibilities of University Secretary, providing leadership for the administration of the Board of Trustees. Her start date is April 14th.\n\nMany of you already know Susan from her nearly 20 years at The New School between 2001 and 2021, and for the deep relationships she developed with faculty and staff as a member of the Office of the General Counsel. During that time, Susan held increasingly responsible positions at The New School, including serving as Vice President, University Secretary, and Associate General Counsel between 2017 and 2021. Throughout her tenure, she advised and participated in the development of numerous global programs, including establishing Parsons Paris as a branch campus and launching programs in India and China; developing policies to protect and nurture our intellectual property; and advising the Board of Trustees and its committees. She returns to our campus with energy, excitement, and an unwavering commitment to renewing existing relationships and building new connections across our community.\n\nSusan joins us from New York University where she was Senior Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary from 2021 – 2025. As a senior legal advisor to NYU’s executive officers, trustees, staff, and faculty, Susan provided expert counsel on a wide range of legal matters, including corporate governance, policy development, major gift awards, and compliance. She began her career as a litigation associate at Baer Marks & Upham LLP.\n\nSusan received her BA from Lehigh University and her JD from Columbia Law School. Passionate about education, Susan has taught at Cardozo School of Law and is a guest lecturer on higher education and the law at NYU’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. In 2021, Susan also led a class on business regulation and practices at Parsons School of Design.\n\nThreaded throughout Susan’s impressive career is her dedication and long history of working as a partner to faculty and staff in ways that advance and amplify innovative and inclusive research, scholarship, and creative practice. I look forward to working closely with Susan and hope you will join me in welcoming her back to The New School.",

    "content": "A Message from President Towers: Leadership Update\n\nThe New School has, for many years, been engaged in an ongoing process to adapt our structures to enable interdisciplinary research and scholarship where we have the opportunity and capacity to lead. At times, the work has waxed and waned. With the beginning of my presidency, I have been especially excited to advance it further and provide structure and leadership in this critical space for our future success and distinction.\n\nTo help us realize this goal, I am pleased to share that I have appointed Jennifer E. Hobbs, currently the Senior Vice President for Administration, University Secretary, and Chief of Staff in the Office of the President, to a newly created role as Senior Vice President for Strategic Partnerships and University Initiatives. Jen will serve as the senior administrative lead of select, prioritized initiatives for the President and the Provost, advising and partnering in their design, planning, socialization, and implementation. This is a multifaceted position that will create administrative structures and systems to elevate the university-wide thematic areas of Climate, Democracy, Cities, and Technology, and will seek to integrate these areas into the university’s academic and operational practices and policies. Reporting to me, Jen will begin in this role on April 14th.\n\nJen joined The New School in 2020 as Senior Vice President for Administration and Chief of Staff in the Office of the President, and in 2021, she was asked to take on additional duties as the University Secretary, providing leadership for the administration of the Board of Trustees. As Senior Vice President, University Secretary, and Chief of Staff, she has served across three Presidents of The New School and has brought the highest standards of professionalism and integrity to every facet of her work. Jen’s contributions to The New School are extensive and reflect her exceptional administrative and strategic support for the university, including university-wide processes for managing collaborative work across university leaders; ensuring alignment and progress across institutional priorities; stewarding the creation of a second Faculty Trustee position and Alumni Trustee positions to serve on the Board of Trustees; engaging, mentoring, and advising students, faculty, and staff; and leading the administrative operations within the Office of the President and the Board of Trustees.\n\nJen and I will be working closely together to position this new role for success, and I know you will join me in my optimism for the good work ahead and the leadership that Jen will bring to this endeavor. Later this week, I will announce a new Chief of Staff in the Office of the President. For now, please join me in expressing the deepest appreciation for Jen’s leadership and continued partnership.",

    "content": "A Message from President Towers: Welcome to the Start of the Spring 2025 Semester\n\nA month ago, as we crossed the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun started to chart a path across the sky that was a little higher with each passing day. In two months we will mark the equinox as winter transitions to spring. As the daily cycle of news, politics, personal sorrows and joys unfurls, I often find it helpful to ground myself in the larger rhythms of life. Doing so offers some perspective even if the frigid cold of this January day makes spring seem far away.\n\nThe days between the end of the fall semester and the start of this new spring term have offered me a chance to reflect on the future of the university. Meetings with the Provost, Deans, Faculty, and Staff throughout the fall have further advanced plans that have been emerging through the academic core work, strategic planning, and the many community meetings I have held with students and the Board over the past six months. I look forward to continuing that work apace as the semester unfolds.\n\nIn my communications with you over the past months, I have often begun with a rereading of our history. I do this to honor and understand where we have come from and to be inspired by where we may go next. Today I am starting from the very beginning.\n\nThe original idea for The New School was drafted sometime around 1918 as World War I was coming to a close. A group of scholars and education reformers gathered in a building on Madison Avenue near 39th Street to draw up a proposal for what they called “An Independent School of Social Science for Men and Women.” In the aftermath of the first global war, the committee’s goal was the establishment of a university for research and teaching that would address the profound challenges confronting the United States. Their focus was national, even as they recognized “the growing complexity and significance of international relations – commercial and diplomatic” that underscored the need for what they described as “a new type of leadership in every field of American life.” The New School they imagined was founded in 1919 and, to this day, remains true to the mission of breaking free from the constraints and norms of higher education to advance the creation of new knowledge and its application to the most pressing issues of our time.\n\nThe New School today educates approximately 9,000 students a year at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral level. Parsons School of Design (founded 1896) joined The New School in 1970 and was followed in 1989 by Mannes College of Music (founded 1916). The University in Exile (Graduate Faculty/NSSR), Lang College, Jazz, Drama, Milano, all emerged from the original New School that would later add Media Studies, Creative Writing, and the first adult bachelor’s degrees through the GI-Bill in support of returning veterans from World War II. With these constituent parts, today we are a comprehensive university whose teaching, research, scholarship, and creative practices include fine art, design, music, performance, the social sciences, liberal arts, management, urban and environmental policy, international affairs, creative writing, media studies, and adult and life-long learning.\n\nFrom humble beginnings a century ago to a leading university with the top-ranked art and design school in the country, The New School has made and remade itself for its time, creating new pathways for higher education. Each generation of The New School has asked: what is the role of the university today? The answer lies in identifying the places and spaces in society that higher education is uniquely positioned to advance, and what is required of the university—any university—to better serve that role.\n\nToday, a series of cross-cutting multidisciplinary themes establish a kind of field-condition for the university, leading to a series of foundational questions. In an age of artificial intelligence and the rapid expansion of digital tools, communication platforms, and industrial technologies, what kind of learning and knowledge is required to direct these transformative capacities toward social and environmental good? Similarly, in a time of global climate change, energy transitions, increasingly catastrophic storms, fires, and heatwaves, biodiversity loss, and the likelihood for displacement creating waves of climate migration of people seeking refuge, what kind of innovative design, policy, technology, and knowledge solutions will be necessary to create a just and resilient transition to a climate resilient future? How will universities deepen their capacity to house the robust ecosystem of ideas and diversity of opinions and experiences that make them the ideal place to educate the next generation of leaders for an increasingly urbanized and culturally diverse world? What is the role of a 21st-century university in preserving and advancing a 21st-century democracy?\n\nAs we design The New School for our time, these university-wide themes touch every part of our teaching, pedagogy, scholarship, and creative practice. They describe a shared ground that the colleges and programs occupy, each in their own way. Climate, Cities, Diversity, and Technology are not the domain of any one discipline alone nor are they silos unto themselves. They are the water we are swimming in, and our capacity to see and respond to them through our creative work, learning, and scholarship will be the measure of our success as a university for today and the future. This semester I will be working to advance these intersecting themes across the university. I look forward to your collaboration and engagement in that work!\n\nI wish you the best for a creative and successful spring semester!",

    "content": "Welcoming Francisco Pineda, Executive Vice President for Business and Operations and Chief Operating Officer\n\nA Message from Joel Towers, President and University Professor\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nI am pleased to share that Francisco X. Pineda will join The New School on January 27th as Executive Vice President for Business and Operations and Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Francisco will serve as a member of the university’s leadership team and will provide strategic oversight for Finance, Business and Resource Services, Safety and Facilities, Human Resources, Labor Relations, and Information Technology. He will partner and collaborate with me, the Provost, Executive Deans, and other university colleagues and stakeholders, including our Trustees, to support the overall mission of the university.\n\nFrancisco brings over 25 years of leadership and operational expertise across business, non-profit, and higher education sectors to The New School. A seasoned strategy, operations, and finance executive, he has successfully led large and small teams at prominent institutions, with a focus on fostering service, mentorship, and a culture of excellence and collaboration. Most recently, Francisco served as the Executive Vice President of Asset Management at the New York City Economic Development Corporation overseeing the City’s extensive real estate portfolio, including commercial, industrial, and strategic properties, as well as economic development assets. His responsibilities also encompassed the City’s river and harbor ports, major urban adaptive reuse projects, and one of the nation’s most ambitious municipal decarbonization initiatives. Throughout his career, Francisco has successfully expanded business lines and educational programs, managing revenue-generating portfolios exceeding $400 million. He has been instrumental in navigating complex debt restructuring processes, mergers, integrations, and structuring numerous equity and debt transactions. Francisco’s extensive background in infrastructure, private equity, and turnaround management, gained through roles at Merrill Lynch, Hess, and BNP Paribas, has enabled him to offer unique insights and valuable contributions to mission-driven and purpose-focused institutions.\n\nA passionate advocate for education, research, and innovation, Francisco served as Columbia University’s Graduate Program Director and Faculty for Construction Administration from 2015 to 2021, where he played a pivotal role in propelling the program to the top of national rankings through his dedication to students, industry, and program faculty. He continued as faculty until September of 2024. His time at Columbia afforded him the opportunity to convene and contribute to national and global initiatives, including serving on high-profile committees such as President Biden’s Infrastructure Policy Committee (2020), the NYC Task Force on Procurement Reform (2022), the World Economic Forum’s Infrastructure 4.0 Working Group, Columbia’s Construction Diversity Initiative, and the MTA’s Major Construction Review Unit.\n\nFrancisco holds an MBA from Columbia Business School, a Master of Public Administration from Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, and a BA in History. He is currently completing his PhD in Urban Systems at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, advancing his research on sustainable regional systems and the intersection of finance, technology, and governance. Francisco is a decorated U.S. Navy veteran who served in support of stability and humanitarian aid operations in Africa, Asia, and alongside UN missions.\n\nFrancisco’s multidisciplinary experience in public service and career in infrastructure, the built environment, and academia make him an ideal addition to our community. He is excited to join The New School and help advance our distinctive mission. I look forward to his partnership as we build an even stronger Business and Operations organization to support our university.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Francisco to The New School.",

    "content": "Cultivated meat aims to provide meat products in a more sustainable way, without slaughtering animals. Those working in the cellular agriculture space—growing new meat products, testing flavors, and determining how to scale up their technologies—hold hope that their new food products could penetrate the market and feed a sizeable number of meat eaters.\n\nBut the current livestock industry involves hundreds of thousands of farmers, meatpacking workers, and other employees, each with their own families and communities. How, exactly, might the growth of a new kind of meat production impact these people?\n\nThat’s the subject of a new research project, led by Nicole Tichenor Blackstone, assistant professor of agriculture, food, and the environment at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Alex Blanchette, associate professor of anthropology in the School of Arts and Sciences, Sean Cash, associate professor of global nutrition at the Friedman School, and Katherine Fuller, an assistant professor of economics at Oregon State University. The project is funded by a grant from the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.\n\nThe project focuses on workers and communities that may be affected by an expansion of cultivated meat production, with particular interest in understanding how a boom in cultivated meat could impact meatpacking workers and cow-calf producers (that is, farmers who raise calves from birth to weaning).\n\nBlackstone, Blanchette, and Meera Zassenhaus, head of communications at the Tufts University Center for Cellular Agriculture (TUCCA) discussed the new project during a panel at the university’s third annual Cellular Agriculture Innovation Day, hosted by TUCCA on January 9.\n\nDetermining Disruptions\n\nIn alternative protein spaces, there is often talk about “‘ending industrial animal agriculture,’” Blackstone said during the panel discussion. “I don’t think that language is helpful. Rather, let’s ask the question from an empirical standpoint: What might actually happen during this kind of a transition?”\n\nTalk of cultivated meat putting farmers out of business has popped up in the media and spurred Florida to instate the nation’s first ban on the manufacture and sale of cultivated meat. “But all of that discourse—both the criticisms being levied against cultivated meat and the rebuttals by the industry itself—have been speculative,” said Zassenhaus. “There’s no research or data mapping out the impacts that this technology might have.”\n\nThe research team plans to fill that gap, starting with travel to Nebraska and Tennessee, which are home to large beef plants and smaller cow-calf operations. There, the researchers will conduct interviews with meatpacking workers and cow-calf producers, asking questions about current working conditions and perceptions of cultivated meat. Information gathered in the interviews will help to refine questions for larger, national surveys of beef producers’ and consumers’ perceptions of cultivated meat.\n\nThe goal is to determine what positive or negative impacts might occur to workers and their communities as cultivated meat enters the market. The research team hopes to learn what the concerns of those working in the livestock industry are. As one example, offered by Blanchette during the panel discussion: “Do meatpacking workers or small beef producers actually see cultivated meat as a threat to their livelihoods?”\n\nUnderstanding those concerns could eventually help to minimize the impacts of a cultivated meat boom on marginalized farmworkers and smallholder farms, Blackstone and Blanchette said. Zassenhaus called this a “just transition” to cellular agriculture—one that, much like a just transition in the clean energy sector, would take the livelihoods of workers into account.\n\n“We often don’t think of farmers as being marginalized, but livestock production, specifically running cow-calf operations, is a top livelihood strategy for Black producers, for Indigenous producers, and for Hispanic producers in this country—folks who have been in many cases actively discriminated against,” Blackstone said. “If we’re going to talk about a transition, we have to be bringing that up.”\n\n“People who are classed as manual laborers in the animal production industries have viewpoints, they have expertise,” said Blanchette. “We really need to pay attention to the people who are oftentimes most marginalized but also most integral to these operations.”\n\nBlackstone also sees the project as an opportunity to connect those working in conventional agriculture with those working in cellular agriculture. The two don’t often interact and may not be familiar with one another’s work. But both groups have a lot to learn from one another, she said.\n\nThe Social Life Cycle\n\nScientists often study the environmental impacts of new technologies via a Life Cycle Assessment, which attempts to summarize the effects of a product over its entire life, from collecting the raw materials for the product, to its manufacturing, to its eventual end-of-life.\n\nThis research team plans to apply the Life Cycle Assessment framework to their study, completing what they call a Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA). The idea of a S-LCA is to evaluate how things like working conditions, the treatment of animals, business viability, or farmer livelihoods vary throughout the supply chain of a product.\n\nWhile there are international standards that give structure to environmental Life Cycle Assessments, S-LCA is a much newer method than a typical environmental LCA, Blackstone said. That means researchers are still figuring out how to do it, but Blackstone hopes that the S-LCA methodology that she and the team develop will be helpful to other researchers assessing the potential social impacts of other new food technologies.\n\n“Where might there be benefits and where might there be costs, and how do we create potential solutions in advance of that?” Blackstone asked.",

    "content": "Leila Fawaz was awarded the Provost’s Medal on December 5 in recognition of her nearly 50-year career as a distinguished social historian of the Eastern Mediterranean region, with specific emphasis on the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nProvost Caroline Genco awarded the medal to Fawaz in a ceremony in Ballou Hall, with dozens of colleagues and friends in attendance. Upon her retirement from Tufts in July 2024, Fawaz was named Issam M. Fares Professor of Lebanese and Eastern Mediterranean Studies Emerita.\n\n“Dr. Fawaz’s international stature and service to her profession outside of Tufts cannot be overstated,” Genco said. “The numerous awards and recognitions she has received from peers, esteemed institutions, and governments could not have been awarded to a more dedicated or deserving scholar.”\n\nOver her 46-year career at Tufts, Fawaz held numerous roles, including chairing the Department of History and serving as dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College and associate dean of the faculty. In 2001, she helped to launch the Fares Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies and served as its founding director until 2012.\n\nAmong those colleagues welcomed to the podium to speak to their personal relationships and professional interactions with Fawaz was Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\n\n“[Leila] has an incredible way of dropping a much-needed pearl of wisdom in your ear when you need it at exactly the right moment and knowing when to give you that right push of encouragement and pat on the back at the time you need it as well,” said Gallagher.\n\nIn describing the significance of Fawaz’s contributions to her field, Gallagher added, “She is a social historian at heart... I think this is what Leila has always been fascinated by, and how she has made such a great mark with her scholarship.”\n\nAlso offering praise to Fawaz was Sol Gittleman, Alice and Nathan Gantcher University Professor Emeritus and former Tufts provost. “Leila Fawaz is what we hope all faculty are in the classroom: enthusiastic, evidence-based, capable of presenting arguments from all sides, insisting that students make up their own minds,” Gittleman said. “Nearly every review of her scholarship talks about the meticulous even-handedness and objectivity of her research, even as her homeland and family were suffering from centuries-old conflicts. As a scholar of the Middle East, she has attained the hard-won historian’s noble dream of finding the truth.”\n\nFawaz is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a member of the Comité Scientifique of the Maison Méditerranéenne des Sciences de l'Homme at the Université d'Aix-Marseille in France. She served on several committees for the European Science Foundation in Strasbourg, France, as well as on committees of the Social Science Research Council, the Steering Committee of the European Science Foundation, and as a delegate to the American Council of Learned Societies.\n\nFawaz has been awarded fellowships from the Social Science Research Council and has received the Lillian Leibner Award for Distinguished Teaching and Advising at Tufts. She served as a visiting professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Politiques et Sociales, Paris, and at the Université de Provence, Aix-en-Provence. In 2000, she received the International Institute of Boston's New Citizen Award, which is given to immigrants who have made significant contributions within their respective communities.\n\nFawaz has served as president of the Middle East Studies Association of North America and of the Alumni Association in North America of the American University of Beirut (AANA). As AANA president, she also served as ex-officio trustee on the American University of Beirut Board of Trustees.\n\nOther recognition for Fawaz includes being named a Chevalier in the French National Order of the Legion of Honor, France's highest award.\n\nThe Provost’s Medal is awarded to distinguished national and international figures as well as those who have performed extraordinary service to the university. The recipient must be both recommended by the provost and approved by the university president. Fawaz is the eleventh recipient of the award since its establishment in 1997. Past recipients of the Provost’s Medal include esteemed philosophers, economists, presidents, CEOs, and deans of Tufts University. The full list of medal recipients can be found on the Provost’s Office website.",

    "content": "President Sunil Kumar\n\n2025 Baccalaureate Service\n\nSaturday, May 17, 2025\n\nOpening\n\nA warm welcome to family, friends, colleagues, guests and most importantly, the Class of 2025!\n\nMost things we celebrate, we achieve with the help of many others. Giving thanks and acknowledging support must go hand-in-hand with celebration.\n\nTherefore, before I speak to the Class of 2025, let me take a moment to ask it, the Class of 2025, to recognize those who have made this day possible for them:\n\nparents…grandparents…siblings…partners…children…and friends\n\nyour teachers, members of the faculty, deans, coaches, advisors, and staff.\n\nGraduates, please stand and applaud these individuals who have contributed to your many successes.\n\n(Pause for applause)\n\nI would also like to thank the students who will enrich this day with important messages of their faiths, traditions, and philosophical perspectives. Thank you to the string quartet and the jazz quartet for sharing your talents with us. (Pause for applause) Enlightening the ceremony through music.\n\nSpecial thanks to Reverend Elyse Nelson Winger and her colleagues in the University Chaplaincy for organizing this afternoon’s celebration. (Pause for applause) And thank you to the staff from across our Operations and Commencement planning teams for making it possible to bring this Tufts tradition outside to the Academic Quad for the first time, which the heavens rewarded, unfortunately, with rain. (Pause for applause)\n\nFinally, thank you, Ayo for that incredible Wendell Phillips address. (Pause for applause) You are an outstanding representative of the Class of 2025, and we are all very proud of you. Stanford is lucky to have you, and I have let them know that.\n\nMoment of Silence\n\nBefore I share my reflections on your Class and what lies ahead for you, I would like to pause for a moment in the memory of Sam Sommers, psychology department chair and professor, highly regarded teacher, impactful researcher, and beloved colleague, who passed away unexpectedly earlier this spring.\n\nSam made everyone around him better…and feel better. Last year, a mass email circulated as an April Fool’s joke, one in poor taste I might add. It announced my sudden demise. (Laughter) As an engineer, I feel obliged to add that it was accurate; merely sent prematurely. (Laughter) Sam came to see me a couple of weeks later. He had had a t-shirt printed up with Mark Twain’s famous quote on a premature obituary and gave it to me. (Laughter) He knew it would cheer me up. We both had a good laugh then.\n\nAlthough no longer with us, Sam leaves behind an enduring legacy in the hearts and minds of his students, colleagues, friends and family, and everyone whose lives he touched. I, for one, will not only treasure that t-shirt but also the funny, kind, and thoughtful person he was.\n\nLet’s pause in a moment of silence in memory of Sam.\n\n[Pause for moment of silence]\n\nThank you.\n\nUniversity’s mission -- responsible leaders\n\nAs you can imagine, I am asked from time to time to define the mission of Tufts University. Without hesitation I reply: “To educate responsible leaders and to do more than our fair share towards addressing the world’s most pressing problems.” To date, no one has quibbled with that definition. It’s a comforting one after all – like mom and apple pie.\n\nBut the skeptic in you is probably asking “what does it take to be a responsible leader, and has Tufts done enough to prepare us for this aspiration?” Such skepticism is good for you. I take these questions very seriously.\n\nTo me a leader is one whose actions will affect many others, and not necessarily always in a positive way, even when the actions are well-intentioned. I realize that this is a very “operationally biased” definition of leadership. This bias reflects my academic training – as I mentioned just a few moments ago, I am an engineer after all.\n\n[Pause]\n\nActions and consequence\n\nThe relationship between actions and consequences is an incomplete and complicated one.\n\nSam Sommer’s sudden passing is a stark and stunning reminder of our limited agency in this world. We do not control outcomes. One of the most cited lines from the Bhagavad Gita, the essential part of the Hindu Scripture, reads कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन। It translates to “You have the right to act but never to the fruits of such action.” We have no rights to outcome.\n\nKnowledge and expertise help limit the uncontrolled parts of outcomes, but they remain, persist nonetheless. A responsible leader acts knowing full well this limitation on agency. The leader relies on knowledge and expertise, especially of those who have dedicated themselves to acquiring such expertise.\n\nBad outcomes cannot be solely attributed to limited agency. We are fallible and we make mistakes. Quite often these errors are caused by hubris. We are sure that we are doing the right thing, only to realize that we were wrong to act the way we did. Moreover, a good outcome does not excuse an erroneous decision.\n\nResponsible leaders have the humility to know they can be wrong, and that the meanest of their detractors may have something they can learn from. They know when they were good and when they were merely lucky. And they learn from these mistakes. I know I certainly have.\n\nFinally, a leader’s decision affects others in many different ways, and often there is no single, “best” decision. To pick among several, less than ideal alternatives, one has to rely on one’s values and principles. Acting on mere expediency never survives the test of time. Almost by definition, what is expedient today ceases to be that tomorrow. So one has to make hard calls.\n\n[Pause]\n\nYou are halfway there\n\nMy goal in laying out this forbidding list of what it takes to be a responsible leader is not to dissuade you or fill you with doubt and anxiety. Nor, heaven forbid, is it to make excuses for my job and the decisions that I have made. Rather, it is to lay out objectively what it takes:\n\nKnowledge and expertise and a willingness to rely on knowledge and expertise\n\nHumility and a willingness to accept and learn from mistakes\n\nA well-developed set of values and principles, unique to you.\n\nWritten this way, the list is not forbidding. If you think, “I got this,” you would be partially right. Your Tufts education, and the very special Tufts community, have given you a great start on each of these dimensions. But none of these are static – they all evolve over time.\n\nAs you develop and strengthen these characteristics over the coming years, remember not just what you learned here. Remember also what it means to be a Jumbo:\n\nYou have the depth and expertise in your chosen area.\n\nYou can think for yourself with clarity and candor\n\nYou have the humility to learn from even those you disagree with, and most importantly, from life\n\nYou know that it is not enough to do well for yourself, it is necessary to do good for others and to take care of the Herd\n\nYou have a set of values and principles that you will constantly test, hone, and refine for yourself.\n\nOn today\n\nI am almost at the end of my remarks and you may be surprised that I haven’t mentioned anything so far about the attacks on higher education or any of the other dramatic developments of the day. It is not that I am not concerned by these. It is just that the appropriate time frame for this address is the rest of your life. Given that, worrying about what happens today seems rather myopic.\n\nThat said, I am relieved that Rümeysa Öztürk has been released to continue her thesis. (Applause) I am glad the university and the Tufts community was able to help her case through sworn declarations and other support. Unfortunately, the future may yet hold curveballs.\n\nOne of my favorite movies is Bridge of Spies, a cold war thriller. In it, a Soviet spy, played by Mark Rylance, is caught in the US. His lawyer asks him if he’s worried. Rylance replies in a flat monotone, “Would it help?”\n\nWhen thrown a curve ball, the key for a responsible leader is not worry, but preparation and considered action. And you are ready now and you will be even more ready in the coming years to prepare yourselves and act in a considered and thoughtful manner when you’re thrown curveballs.\n\nFor its part, the university will continue to act in a manner that maximally furthers its mission – of educating responsible leaders and doing more than its share of addressing the world’s greatest challenges, while doing the very best it possibly can for every member of the Herd. And we have you, our responsible future leaders, to count on.\n\nGo Jumbos! Now and forever!\n\n(Applause)",

    "content": "Tufts University Declaration for Rümeysa Öztürk\n\nApril 2, 2025\n\nDear Tufts community,\n\nPlease see below a declaration by Tufts University in support of a motion filed today by Rümeysa Öztürk’s legal team in Öztürk v. Hyde in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSunil Kumar\n\nPresident\n\nDECLARATION OF TUFTS UNIVERSITY\n\nTufts University (an entity legally known as “The Trustees of Tufts College” and henceforth referred to as “Tufts University”, the “University” or “Tufts”), declares as follows:\n\n1. On Tuesday, March 25, 2025, the University learned that Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts doctoral student from Turkey, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security as she was leaving her off-campus apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. The University understands that she was leaving her home that evening for an Iftar dinner hosted at the Tufts Interfaith Center where she would break her Ramadan fast for the day.\n\n2. At around 6:30 p.m. that evening, the Tufts University Police Department received courtesy notification from the Somerville Police Department that an individual had been detained by federal authorities and that the person in custody might be a Tufts student. We confirmed through our records that the person in question was Rümeysa Öztürk.\n\n3. At 7:32 p.m., Ms. Öztürk’s record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was updated to note that her visa was terminated. Prior to that, and at the time of her detention, Ms. Öztürk was in “good immigration standing” according to her record in SEVIS, and both Ms. Öztürk and Tufts had followed the governing regulations for students on visas. The University then received a notice, dated March 25, 2025 and received via email on March 26, 2025 at 10:31 a.m., stating that Rümeysa’s visa was cancelled because she was a “non-immigrant status violator” (citing 237 (a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act) and/or that the United States believed that her presence in the country would result in “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States” (citing 237 (a)(4)(C)(i)).\n\n4. With her consent, the University can confirm that Ms. Öztürk is a fifth-year* doctoral student in good academic and administrative standing. Her research focuses on how young adults can use social media in positive, prosocial ways and she is described by her faculty as a hard-working student dedicated to her studies and the Tufts community. The University has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention. The University has seen an outpouring of support for Ms. Öztürk over the last week from Tufts students, faculty and staff. These individuals have described Ms. Öztürk as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits and committed to her colleagues.\n\n5. The University can confirm that Ms. Öztürk was one of several authors of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, The Tufts Daily, published on March 26, 2024, entitled: “Try again, President Kumar: Renewing Calls for Tufts to Adopt March 4 TCU Senate resolutions.” The University declares that this opinion piece was not in violation of any Tufts policies. Further, no complaints were filed with the University or, to our knowledge, outside of the University about this op-ed. The University maintains that the op-ed was consistent with speech permitted by the Declaration on Freedom of Expression adopted by our trustees on November 7, 2009. For the record, a search of The Tufts Daily will reveal op-eds on multiple sides of the issue with opinions that were shared just as strongly as the op-ed Ms. Öztürk co-authored. The University has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.\n\n6. Our international students, faculty, and staff are vital to deliver on the education, teaching, research, and public service mission of Tufts University. The University sponsors 1,818 continuing international students on F-1 visas, alongside 569 alumni who are pursuing post-completion work authorization in the United States, 24 degree and non-degree students on J-1 visas. This is in addition to the broader community of students, faculty, and staff that hold various immigrant and non-immigrant statuses.\n\n7. The free movement of our international community members is therefore essential to the functioning of the University and serving our mission. The University has heard from students, faculty and staff who are forgoing opportunities to speak at international conferences and avoiding or postponing international travel. In the worst cases, many report being fearful of leaving their homes, even to attend and teach classes on campus.\n\n8. The University declares that many of these students will go on to make significant economic and intellectual contributions to the United States and in countries around the world. They will do so by working in or building new companies, through teaching and research in universities and other academic and healthcare institutions, and through public service in the United States and across the globe. The University is confident in its declaration because thousands of Tufts University alumni have received their education while on F-1 visas and have gone on to make a positive impact to the economic prosperity and intellectual success of the United States and in other countries.\n\n9. The undersigned submits this declaration, on behalf of Tufts University, in support of Ms. Öztürk and asks that she receive the due process rights to which she is entitled. Based on everything we know and have shared here, the University seeks relief so that Ms. Öztürk is released without delay so that she can return to complete her studies and finish her degree at Tufts University.\n\nOn behalf of the University, the undersigned declares under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\n\nExecuted on April 1, 2025, at Tufts University.\n\nSUNIL KUMAR\n\nPRESIDENT, TUFTS UNIVERSITY\n\n*The official filing mistakenly said she was a third-year doctoral student.",

    "content": "Update on Tufts student taken into custody\n\nMarch 26, 2025\n\nDear members of the Tufts community,\n\nWe are writing to provide an update following President Kumar’s message yesterday evening. We have recently learned and verified that Rumeysa Öztürk, the student who was detained by federal immigration authorities yesterday, is currently being held in Louisiana.\n\nWe recognize how frightening and distressing this situation is for her, her loved ones, and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff, and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events. As noted by the Massachusetts Attorney General in her statement today, the footage of Rumeysa’s arrest is disturbing. We stand with our Muslim students, especially during their observance of Ramadan, as we recognize that Rumeysa was on her way to an Iftar gathering with friends at the Interfaith Center when she was detained.\n\nWe are in touch with local, state, and federal elected officials and hope that Rumeysa is provided the opportunity to avail herself of her due process rights. The university is actively working to support the Tufts community as it mobilizes its collective resources and contacts to ensure our students’ safety and wellbeing.\n\nWe want you to know, we are also here to support you—whether you are a student, or a staff or faculty member. Below, we are sharing the resources that the university is making available to all those who may be affected within our community.\n\nProtocol for engaging with government officials\n\nWe want to remind you that the university has an established protocol for responding to government officials who arrive on campus for an unannounced site visit; this protocol also applies to members of our community who encounter officials off campus. To activate that protocol, it is best to call the Tufts University Police Department at 617-627-3030 and inform the dispatcher, who will notify the appropriate university officials, including the Office of University Counsel, the International Center, and other relevant offices at the university. This line is staffed 24/7 and you will get an immediate response from a trained member of the Public Safety team. To the extent possible, and depending on the specifics of each situation, the university will provide relevant guidance, including possibly connecting individuals to external legal and immigration expertise and resources as needed.\n\nRecommended documentation to prove immigration status\n\nImmigration law requires nonimmigrants and lawful permanent residents to carry proof of immigration registration. In particular, “every alien\" 18 years of age and over must \"carry with him and have in his personal possession\" [his or her] \"evidence of registration document \"at all times,\" even during domestic travel and when going about daily activities.\n\nMore information on this requirement, including a list of acceptable documents, is available here: Requirements to Carry Immigration Registration Document and Report Change of Address | NAFSA .\n\nTravel-related inquiries\n\nThe International Center has advised Tufts-sponsored visa holders to consult with the center prior to engaging in international travel.\n\nUse the Tufts Travel Registry to register your travel so that the center can offer timely support in the event of any delays or difficulties re-entering the United States.\n\nAdditional information regarding general immigration questions is available here: https://provost.tufts.edu/federal-actions-resources/immigration-faq/\n\nResources for Support\n\nWe also wanted to remind you of the support available on campus, which we shared yesterday:\n\nThe International Center is available to provide additional support and resources for their community, as well as to direct questions or concerns to partners on campus.\n\nIf you’re not sure what resources or supports are available, please connect with the corresponding resources available for your school as listed here .\n\nFor all members of the Tufts community, the University Chaplaincy can provide additional support regardless of denomination or belief.\n\nStaff and faculty can access the Tufts Employee Assistance Program for support at any time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSunil Kumar\n\nPresident\n\nCaroline Attardo Genco\n\nProvost and Senior Vice President\n\nMichael W.

The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event, and the location where this took place is not affiliated with Tufts University.\n\nFrom what we have been told subsequently, the student’s visa has been terminated, and we seek to confirm whether that information is true. The university has no additional information at this time about the cause or circumstances of the student’s apprehension and is attempting to learn more about the incident. Following university protocol, the Office of University Counsel will assist in connecting the student to external legal resources should the individual request our assistance.\n\nWe realize that tonight’s news will be distressing to some members of our community, particularly the members of our international community. We will continue to provide information, support, and resources in the days ahead as more details become available to us. While we await further information, we want to remind the members of our community that the university has an established protocol for responding to government agents who arrive on campus (or off-campus), for an unannounced site visit.

Here’s how to get started:\n\nThe International Center is available to provide additional student support and resources for their community, as well as to direct questions or concerns to partners on campus.\n\nIf you’re not sure what resources or supports are available, please connect with the corresponding resources available for your school as listed here .\n\nFor all members of the Tufts community, the University Chaplaincy can provide additional support regardless of denomination or belief.\n\nStaff and faculty can access the Tufts Employee Assistance Program for support at any time.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nSunil Kumar",

    "content": "Update on the Impact of Federal Actions\n\nMarch 11, 2025\n\nDear students, faculty, and staff,\n\nThis has been an extremely turbulent time for higher education, as actions in Washington impact our university. It is important for our community to understand the steps we have taken and our thoughts on the path forward.\n\nWe firmly believe in our mission: to educate responsible leaders and to do more than our fair share in addressing humanity’s most pressing problems. We will engage in this mission regardless of the uncertainties we face today and those we will confront tomorrow. Moreover, our values will not change. We will remain committed to academic excellence by keeping the doors to our campuses open to scholars and students with diverse, varied perspectives and backgrounds from across the country and around the world. Our community is strongest when we bring these different perspectives and experiences together to pursue unfettered intellectual inquiry. We will defend our mission and values.\n\nThose of us in leadership at the university have been collectively working diligently to advance our mission, values, and interests. President Kumar has been meeting with elected officials at the local, state, and national levels to ensure that they know the impact these federal actions will have on our community and the damage they may do to the competitiveness and security of the United States. He has also met with students in small groups to hear firsthand how federal actions are impacting them, and he has spent time listening to the concerns of faculty and staff at faculty and department meetings over the past month and a half. Provost Genco has been leading town hall meetings for faculty and staff to discuss the impact of federal directives on their work, and her team has been meeting with students and faculty individually and in small groups to understand and address concerns. The deans at each of our schools have been engaging with their communities to discuss and address local impacts.\n\nTo ensure that everyone understands our efforts, we want to share some details about how we are working across the university to mitigate the impact of federal actions.\n\nFederal funding impacts on research\n\nSignificant changes have impacted our research portfolio at two federal funding agencies: the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nOver the past month, USAID has terminated nearly all of its funded research projects and, as of February 23, put almost all agency personnel on administrative leave. At Tufts, these USAID award terminations have impacted 12 projects, eight of which involved direct awards to the university. We encourage you to learn more about these projects on the federal actions resources page on the provost’s website.\n\nWe are working with researchers and their schools to assess and address the impact of these and any additional award terminations that might be made in the days ahead. Although the university will work painstakingly to find new funding sources for this work and for those impacted, we recognize that there will be negative impacts on our community.\n\nIn addition, last month, the NIH announced that it was capping facilities and administration (F&A) costs at a flat rate of 15 percent immediately, irrespective of the rates that individual universities had previously negotiated. In the ensuing lawsuit challenging the directive, which Tufts joined as a co-plaintiff, the judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction stating that the rate cut would cause irreparable injury and violated federal law.\n\nF&A costs, often called “indirect costs,” have been portrayed by some as unnecessary and wasteful, written off simply as “overhead.” In fact, F&A funds are used for a range of critical needs that enable research to take place, from maintaining and operating the physical spaces and laboratories where the federally funded research will take place to funding staff members who ensure that research is conducted safely in compliance with applicable regulations, and guidelines. We encourage you to take a few minutes to watch this video from the AAU about the importance of these funds.\n\nEven if the NIH lawsuit is ultimately decided in our favor, it is important to remember that our currently negotiated rate structure, which can be found on the Office of the Vice Provost for Research website, can be legally renegotiated by the government after complying with the process outlined in federal law. It is, therefore, imperative that we look for ways to be more efficient in how we conduct research across the university and that we seek to diversify our funding sources to make us more resilient moving forward. We are assembling a group of deans and senior leaders to prepare such plans.\n\nDirectives that impact Immigration and Institutional Inclusive Excellence at Tufts\n\nThe federal government has issued several executive orders relating to immigration that have the potential to impact members of our community. It has also issued several executive orders relating to diversity, including gender identity. Most of these orders are not very specific and require agencies and departments to develop plans over 60 or 90 days, and some of the orders have been put on hold due to a court-ordered injunction on a lawsuit filed by several national organizations, including the AAUP and NADOHE. As a result, we do not currently know what direct impact these executive orders will have on our community. We are also working diligently to understand the potential impact on our university and are collaborating with national organizations such as the AAU and the ACE to understand the scope and breadth of the directives. Community members should contact the Office of Institutional Inclusive Excellence for guidance and support.\n\nOur International Center has been providing guidance to international students and scholars on F-1 or J-1 visas and international faculty and staff with temporary employment visas. We continue to encourage international students, faculty, and staff to contact the International Center to discuss travel plans or ask for guidance managing potential risks.\n\nWe know the fear and concerns that have rippled through our community over the past two months. We will stand with all our community members, and we pledge to support you to the utmost extent we can.\n\nWe anticipate that the situation will remain volatile and uncertain in the near future. This is where the resilience of the Tufts community to support one another will be most needed. While some of us will be more directly affected than others, we must all remember that an impact on one is an impact on all. Moving forward, we will continue to keep you updated about our efforts to advance our work and our mission.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSunil Kumar\n\nPresident\n\nCaroline Attardo Genco\n\nProvost and Senior Vice President\n\nMichael W.

    "content": "Tufts University has joined other AAU institutions to challenge administration's decision to cut NIH funding\n\nFebruary 10, 2025\n\nDear faculty and staff,\n\nWe are writing to let you know that Tufts University has joined with numerous American Association of Universities (AAU) institutions, the AAU itself, the American Council of Education, and the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities to challenge the administration’s decision, announced Friday night, to cut the NIH facilities and administrative costs to a flat rate of 15 percent. We believe that these changes were not made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and, therefore, are in violation of the law.\n\nThe long-standing research partnership between the federal government and institutions of higher education has fueled innovation that has led to cures for diseases, treatments to reduce suffering, and devices to help people live longer and healthier lives. University-based research has strengthened America’s national security and improved our economy through job creation, increased spending, and rising tax revenue. Tufts is proud of its role in this partnership.\n\nWe are currently receiving $115.2 million in NIH funds, including $88.3 million in direct costs and $26.9 million in facilities and administrative costs. The facilities and administrative costs, also known as indirect costs, include funds to cover Tufts’ basic research infrastructure and equipment such as biocontainment laboratories, bench research space, fume hoods, autoclaves, high-speed data processing, security and data storage for sensitive health information, and refrigeration for specimen storage. In addition, facilities and administrative costs fund the administration of awards, including staff who ensure compliance with a vast number of regulatory mandates from agencies such as NIH. In short, these funds enable the research to happen. (For more information about facilities and administrative costs and other related topics, please visit this FAQ.)\n\nNIH funds support more than 200 projects across the university, accounting for 60 percent of the university’s federally funded research portfolio. Among these research projects are efforts to cure Lyme disease, protect humanity from the global threat of antimicrobial resistance or “superbugs,” and accelerate biomedical research's translation into impact on patient care and public health.\n\nWe want to be as transparent as we can be at this point. If these cuts to NIH funding stand, the impact on Tufts will be significant. The university does not have the resources to absorb these additional facilities and administrative costs, and, as a result, we will need to reduce the NIH-funded research done at the university. This would be a terrible outcome. Even if the cuts are restored, we will need to be agile, prudent, and efficient in delivering on our research mission moving forward.\n\nWe will keep in touch as the situation evolves.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSunil Kumar\n\nPresident\n\nCaroline Attardo Genco\n\nProvost and Senior Vice President\n\nMichael W. Howard\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\nBernard Arulanandam\n\nVice Provost for Research",

    "content": "The Value of International Collaborations\n\nPresident Sunil Kumar delivered the following speech at the 1200th Anniversary at the University of Pavia on January 20, 2025:\n\nBuongiorno!\n\nThat’s the limit of my Italian. [LAUGHTER]\n\nIt is my privilege to be here today in this spectacular theater. I am honored and humbled to be invited as a speaker at this opening ceremony of the 24-25 academic year. I would like to thank Rettore Francesco Svelto for inviting me to this historic event marking the 1200th year since the edict of Emperor Lothair the First established a higher education center in Pavia. Welcome to all the faculty, students, and friends of the university who are joining us today. Thank you for being here. It is an honor for me.\n\nDays, such as today, of high ceremony are not merely meant to celebrate past accomplishments or simple longevity. Rather, they are meant to reaffirm commitment, with renewed vigor, to uphold the values that have sustained this university over the past centuries, to be steadfast in the search for knowledge, to educate future generations to be productive and responsible citizens and leaders in society, and to make a positive and material difference in addressing some of the most pressing problems facing humanity today.\n\nAs we contemplate this commitment, we must reflect on how we got here. I must admit that I am not as conversant with the 1200-year history of the University of Pavia as I am with the 175-year history of Tufts University. But it would be very strange indeed if certain parallels did not exist between the two universities. Both universities, I believe, got here for several key necessary reasons: The foundation by a few forward-thinking individuals, the brilliance and accomplishments of the faculty, students, and alumni and the careful stewardship, not only of finances and infrastructure, but of values and culture. But the list above suggests a deterministic process that simply followed a plan. This cannot possibly be true. Not many institutions from the Middle Ages, or even the early 19th century, have survived. So, this list must be necessary, but is not sufficient. There must have been “accidents of history” that led to this particular evolution of the university.\n\nWhich brings me to my first main point: such accidents of history would not have occurred without the members of the university taking risks and being open to, and inclusive of, ideas, programs and people well beyond the university’s campus, province, or country. I can point to many examples of this at Tufts, starting with its very founding. It was founded under Universalist unitarian principles, at a time when the founding members were often excluded from other colleges precisely because of these beliefs. Giorgio Blandrata, one of the founders of unitarianism, taught medicine in Pavia until 1556. When the inquisition chased him away to Switzerland. His intellectual and religious descendants founded Tufts in 1852.\n\nDespite its Universalist roots, Tufts was progressive in its approach to education, encouraging applications from all qualified students regardless of race or religion. Today, we are a non-sectarian institution with an inclusive student body. Further, our founders had the audacity to demand that the university (at that time a small liberal arts college) be the “light on the hill for all its neighbors,” creating a sense of civic engagement and societal obligation that is strong even today at the university. No doubt, a much longer list of such risk-taking and audaciously extending the university beyond the usual exists at Pavia.\n\nAs the university evolved, Tufts took risks and allowed the fortuitous accidents of history to occur, resulting in a constellation of schools, ranging from Veterinary Medicine to Law and Diplomacy, from Nutrition to Engineering, from Fine Arts to Medicine. But it never lost sight of being a liberal arts college. This seeming contradiction is the driver of our excellence at Tufts – we are strong precisely because our constituent parts are so different from one another. These disparate schools are part of the same university for obvious, pragmatic reasons: no one school has all the resources it needs to deliver on its mission, and the world’s pressing problems don’t neatly compartmentalize along our organizational divisions. Collaborations to share resources and to divide and conquer are good, but they are not ideal.\n\nWhich brings me to my second main point: being different is good among partners, as long as they share values and goals. Afterall, the best partner for a left shoe is a right shoe. For example, Tufts has a very impactful research program in Infectious diseases because it has both a school of Human Medicine and a school of Veterinary Medicine. It allows us to study diseases from a One Health perspective, across many species. An often-misquoted phrase in English is “the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.” This quote is from Aristotle, and in its entirety reads “For the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts, there must be something in the substance.” That “something” in collaborations and partnerships is the combination of a commonality in values and goals on the one hand, and a wide variety in capabilities and approaches on the other. This to me is the key to collaboration. In particular, it urges us to consider international collaboration between diverse partners.\n\nTufts has always felt that international collaboration between widely disparate partners makes it deliver better on its chosen mission: educate responsible future leaders and to do more than its fair share to address some of the world’s most pressing problems. It believes that it must be creative and inclusive in its choice of international partners. 30 years ago, it helped create the Talloires Network of Engaged Universities, named after our small European campus at Talloires in the Haute Savoie in France. Today, the Talloires Network is a coalition of a few hundred, very different, institutions across nearly 80 countries, focusing on how universities can foster civic engagement in their faculty and students, and driving universities to be forces of good in their communities.\n\nOn many dimensions, Tufts and the University of Pavia are very different. One is public, the other is private. One is large, the other medium sized. One has had a law school since the early 800s. The other didn’t have a professional school until the 20th century. And its school of Law and Diplomacy doesn’t actually offer a law degree. Good heretics in the 16th century were our founders. And you will be shocked by what passes for risotto in our student cafeterias. I could go on and on, but you get the point. We are different, very different. Superficially, this would suggest that we should not be partners – we are too different. But, as I have argued before, this is a strength, not a weakness. It is not a defect, but a feature.\n\nOur collaboration started 11 years ago, and most appropriately, in the arts. It was an exchange program between our respective Departments of Music that ran for 5 years. The partnership included short-term teaching residencies in Cremona, teaching courses in music history and ethnomusicology. Such partnerships have continued, and I won’t bore you with listing all of them. And of course, such academic partnerships are best when they are program to program, researcher to researcher. A wonderful example of this is the collaboration between Tufts’ own Professor Fiorenzo Omenetto and your Professor Francesco Svelto, not in his role as Rettore of course, but in his role as Professor of Engineering.\n\nThere are a variety of programs across which we can, and intend to, collaborate even more closely. From Engineering to International Relations to the Arts. I am looking forward to meeting with university leaders later today to discuss the potential for students to earn double degrees, one from each university. As an American, I can’t help but ask, why settle for one degree when you can get two? And if we can get our collaborations right, you will have something unique. A combination that goes beyond mere doubling that would be particularly impactful in students’ lives.\n\nThis is, undoubtedly, a time when scholarship and expertise is under assault in many parts of the globe. The value of the university itself is doubted in many powerful quarters. But this is not the time for universities like Pavia or Tufts to huddle back into our shells. As I said at the beginning, today is a day to reaffirm commitment to uphold the values that have sustained our universities over the past centuries, to be steadfast in the search for knowledge, to educate future generations to be productive and responsible citizens and leaders in society, and to make a positive and material difference in addressing some of the most pressing problems.\n\nMake no mistake— this is not as easy as it sounds. Needless to say, it will require the brilliance and accomplishments of the faculty, students, and alumni and careful stewardship, not only of finances and infrastructure, but of values and culture. But that will not suffice. The university will need to take risks and be open to, and inclusive of, ideas, people and programs well beyond the campus.\n\nEvery year, I advise students who are matriculating to Tufts to get comfortable with discomfort, and to try anything that interests them. Stretching ourselves, even to the point of discomfort, helps us build experience, learning about ourselves, identify our purpose, and make a difference. Institutions too, however old and venerable, have the same responsibility: to stretch our boundaries, even to the point of discomfort, and collaborate broadly, even across obvious barriers. I believe that is the best way to ensure that centuries from now, there is another, similar, celebration on this very campus.\n\nEvery morning, I wake up feeling privileged to be an academic, to be a professor living on a university campus. If I may be allowed to butcher Dante, our campuses are cities of joy. Anyone who passes through our campus gates is filled with hope for the future.\n\nMay the University of Pavia, this city of joy, fill anyone who passes through its gates with hope for another 1200 years! And may Tufts University stand by your side as your partner and celebrate your success!\n\nGrazie mille.",

Previously, she served as the director of residential master’s programs in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was an associate professor.\n\nSong’s arrival at the university will mark a return to familiar territory. She began her faculty career at Ohio State in 2007 — the same year the College of Public Health was established — as an assistant professor in the Division of Health Services Management and Policy. She also served as a faculty affiliate for the Institute for Population Research.\n\n“It is such a privilege to return and lead this fantastic college,” Song said. “There is so much talent, passion and dedication among the faculty and staff. They are leaders in public health research and education, dedicated to making a lasting impact. Our equally passionate students are poised to be the next generation of public health and health administration leaders.”\n\nA gifted scholar, Song’s research interests are centered on the financial management of health care organizations and the impact of payment policies on patient and provider experiences. Her research has appeared in numerous peer-reviewed publications, and she has authored or coauthored several book chapters and multiple editions of leading health care finance textbooks.\n\nSong earned her PhD in health services organization and policy, her master’s degree in applied economics, and her Master of Health Services Administration from the University of Michigan. She completed her undergraduate studies in biological basis and behavior at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“Returning to Ohio State feels like coming full circle and a true homecoming for me,” said Song. “I am deeply committed, personally and professionally, to the success of our students, faculty and staff. I am excited to be a Buckeye again!”\n\nOhio State's College of Public Health is the state's first accredited public health college. It is ranked first in Ohio, 16th nationwide among public institutions and 29th overall by U.S. News and World Report.\n\nNationally ranked graduate specialties within the college include Master of Health Administration (8), biostatistics (22), epidemiology (25) and health policy and management (17). The college has five divisions spanning the breadth of public health.\n\nSince 2023, Karla Zadnik has served as interim dean of the College of Public Health. From January 2024 through January 2025, Zadnik also served as the university’s interim executive vice president and provost, and in this role she was instrumental in overseeing the search process and recruiting Song to Ohio State. Upon Song’s July 9 arrival, Zadnik will resume her duties as dean of the College of Optometry.\n\n“I am grateful for Dr. Zadnik’s steady leadership and stewardship of this search, and I also thank the members of the search advisory committee for their input and perspectives,” said Bellamkonda. The committee was chaired by Rustin Moore, the Rita Jean Wolfe Endowed Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine.",

    "content": "I am pleased to share that Trevor Brown will be appointed to a third term as dean of the John Glenn College of Public Affairs, effective July 1, 2025, pending approval of the full Board of Trustees. Dean Brown has led the college since its inception in 2015 and has served on the faculty since 2001.\n\nTrevor is a highly respected scholar whose research focuses on public management and organizational theory, contracting and contract management, and strategic management and performance measurement. He is a collaborative leader who works with other colleges and units to advance Ohio State’s land-grant mission and enhance its reputation across Ohio and the nation. In that spirit, he also has been serving as interim dean of the Max M. Fisher College of Business while the search for Fisher’s next leader continues. He previously served as senior advisor to the provost and executive dean of the professional colleges.\n\nUnder Trevor’s leadership, the Glenn College faculty has grown and increased its impact, propelling a rise to 16th in the 2024 U.S. News & World Report rankings. The college is also No. 8 among U.S. institutions in the 2024 ShanghaiRanking’s Global Ranking of Academic Subjects.\n\nOver the last five years, the college has expanded its undergraduate offerings with new General Education courses and minors, and enhanced opportunities for graduate students with the introduction of an online Master of Public Administration and Leadership, and a Washington, D.C.-specific pathway for Master of Public Administration students. The college also increased its professional offerings, including the introduction of a leadership certificate for veterans transitioning to civilian careers, a leadership program tailored to state and local elected officials, and a version of the college’s Certificate in Public and Nonprofit Leadership designed specifically for Ohio State leaders and launched in partnership with Human Resources.\n\nMore recently, Trevor has assisted in the launch of the Salmon P. Chase Center for Civics, Culture, and Society, and he has served as an advisor for key university initiatives, including Listen. Learn. Discuss. Trevor has also performed leadership roles in the field of public affairs, most recently in 2022-2023 as president of the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration, the field’s accrediting body. He is a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.\n\nThank you to our colleagues in the Glenn College who provided thoughtful insights as part of the reappointment review process — and thank you to Karla Zadnik, who oversaw this review from beginning to end while she was serving as our interim provost.\n\nI’m grateful to Dean Trevor Brown for his dedication to Ohio State and the faculty, staff and students of the Glenn College. I look forward to supporting the continued positive momentum under his thoughtful leadership.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRavi V. Bellamkonda\n\nExecutive Vice President and Provost",

As my wife, Lalita, and I get acquainted with our new surroundings, we are continuing to discover how special Ohio State is! All the people we’ve interacted with so far have been warm and wonderful, truly love Ohio State, and are eager to go on a journey to define and discover what it means to relentlessly pursue academic excellence!\n\nThis past November, I was thrilled to attend President Walter “Ted” Carter Jr.’s investiture as Ohio State’s 17th president. It was an outstanding ceremony, and it reaffirmed my belief that joining Ohio State is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my career. I am grateful that President Carter has placed his trust in me to serve as your chief academic officer, and I am honored to work closely with him, and with all of you, to define and advance academic excellence as part of the Education for Citizenship 2035 framework.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, I look forward to discovering our campuses and meeting faculty, staff and students across Ohio State’s 15 colleges. As your provost, I have an unwavering commitment to creating environments where students can thrive, and faculty can flourish. Together, I know we can build continued distinction for Ohio State by leveraging our academic strengths, while honoring this cherished institution’s land-grant heritage.\n\nThere is much to be done, but I am inspired by Ohio State’s unlimited potential and deeply engaged faculty, staff, students and alumni. I can’t wait to learn more about the people and places that make this university exceptional.\n\nI wish you a healthy, successful and productive spring semester.\n\nRavi V.

    "content": "Happy New Year, Buckeyes!\n\nI’m excited to welcome you to what promises to be an incredible spring semester at The Ohio State University.\n\nMother Nature may have disrupted our plans to be fully back together in-person today, but after all, adaptability is what being a Buckeye is all about. I want to thank each of you for your flexibility in responding to the winter weather challenges, and especially our many teams who have been working tirelessly to prepare our campus for our safe return.\n\nNew beginnings are always meaningful, but this new year is particularly special for Lynda and me, as it was one year ago that we had the privilege of joining the Ohio State family.\n\nWhat a year it’s been. As a university community, we’ve celebrated so many milestones, like record successes in enrollment, research and health care that are creating true impact for students, our communities and the people we serve.\n\nMost exciting to me is what’s ahead: 2025 will be a historic year for Ohio State.\n\nI’m not just talking about our playoff run, though I can’t wait to cheer on our football team this Friday in Dallas. This is the year that we will put forward a new vision for the future of public higher education.\n\nAs I’ve shared before, I think that future is right here at The Ohio State University. I am proud of the early work we’ve done to formulate a plan for our next decade, and I’m energized about the work ahead to put your ideas into actionable strategies that will guide us forward. No doubt, this work will require us to think more boldly and creatively than ever before. We will need to carefully consider our North Star of academic excellence and determine how best to set ourselves apart, make a Buckeye education accessible to every student, and meet the needs of a growing, changing Ohio and world.\n\nI know we’ll be up to the task. With the talent and commitment we have in place, I believe the plan we will develop together will do nothing short of change the conversation around higher education.\n\nThank you for all you do for Ohio State. Please stay safe and warm, and I look forward to connecting with you again soon.\n\nTed\n\nTed Carter, President\n\nThe Ohio State University",

    "content": "The Office of Academic Affairs is sharing resources and support to assist all Ohio State faculty and instructors during the spring semester.\n\nReligious accommodations\n\nOhio State has had a longstanding practice of making reasonable academic accommodations for students’ religious beliefs and practices in accordance with applicable law.\n\nStudents must be in early communication with their instructors regarding any known accommodation requests for religious beliefs and practices, providing notice of specific dates for which they request alternative accommodations within 14 days after the first instructional day of the course. Instructors in turn shall not question the sincerity of a student’s religious or spiritual belief system in reviewing such requests and shall keep requests for accommodations confidential.\n\nWith sufficient notice, instructors will provide students with reasonable alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other academic requirements with respect to students’ sincerely held religious beliefs and practices by allowing up to three absences each semester for the student to attend or participate in religious activities. Examples of religious accommodations can include, but are not limited to, rescheduling an exam, altering the time of a student’s presentation, allowing make-up assignments to substitute for missed class work, or flexibility in due dates or research responsibilities. If concerns arise about a requested accommodation, instructors are to consult their tenure initiating unit head for assistance.\n\nA student’s request for time off shall be provided if the student’s sincerely held religious belief or practice severely affects the student’s ability to take an exam or meet an academic requirement and the student has notified their instructor, in writing during the first 14 days after the course begins, of the date of each absence. Although students are required to provide notice within the first 14 days after a course begins, instructors are strongly encouraged to work with the student to provide a reasonable accommodation if a request is made outside the notice period.\n\nLearn more\n\nWeather or other short-term closing\n\nFollowing Policy 6.15 (Weather or Other Short-Term Closing), instructors are to notify students of alternative teaching methods when in-person classes are canceled. Alternative teaching methods can include virtual synchronous class meetings or asynchronous activities, including but not limited to videos, podcasts, supplemental readings, or discussion posts. It is at the discretion of the instructor as to which alternative method of teaching will occur when in-person classes have been canceled under the Weather or Other Short-Term Closing Policy. Instructors teaching multiple sections of the same course are to consult with their TIU head to ensure consistency with the course continuity plan. Instructors are to discuss their continuity plan with students and include language in their syllabus. Examples could include the following:\n\nShould in-person classes be canceled, we will meet virtually via CarmenZoom during our regularly scheduled time. I will share any updates via [CarmenCanvas, email or other mode of communication].\n\nOR\n\nShould in-person classes be canceled, I will notify you as to which alternative methods of teaching will be offered to ensure continuity of instruction for this class. Communication will be via [CarmenCanvas, email or other mode of communication].\n\nFor faculty teaching online, you are encouraged to include the following: “Unless otherwise announced by the university, online or distance-learning classes will occur as scheduled.”\n\nFree speech, academic freedom and freedom of expression\n\nOhio State is steadfastly committed to protecting the First Amendment right to free speech, academic freedom, and freedom of expression on its campuses. The Campus Free Speech Policy, adopted in May 2023, supports this commitment.\n\nOhio State believes in academic freedom where the exchange of ideas by students and instructors creates a campus environment where all viewpoints are welcome and respected. In accordance with university rules, faculty have the freedom to discuss in classrooms, in their own manner, material that is relevant to the subject matter as defined in the course syllabus. At the same time, they have responsibility to encourage free discussion and inquiry, and students must be given a broad latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, learn and discuss in classrooms and learning spaces.\n\nFreedom of expression is also central to our values as an institution of higher education. Ohio State supports the rights of its students, faculty, staff, volunteers, visitors, community partners and program participants to exercise their freedom of speech and expression in a way that is lawful, respectful and productive. The university encourages everyone to participate in public discourse and exercise their democratic rights through voting, advocacy and civic engagement.\n\nThe Freedom of Expression website is an online hub for support resources, policies and other information to help everyone participate in public discourse and exercise their rights. It includes Ohio State's University Space Standards, updated with input from students, faculty and staff to improve clarity and add detail. The website also now includes more comprehensive information about reserving space and better connects to relevant support and policy resources.\n\nTo maintain neutrality that assures academic freedom and freedom of speech and expression, Ohio State refrains from taking institutional positions on matters that extend beyond the university. When statements are issued, the university uses a framework to evaluate making institutional and leadership statements to ensure decisions are made based on consistent factors.\n\nUniversity employees are encouraged to fully and freely express their personal opinions regarding political candidates, issues, local, state and national programs, initiatives and referendums. However, as employees of a public institution there are restrictions on exercising these rights in a manner that suggests university endorsement of a cause or candidate. Restriction details are explained in the university's political activity guidelines.\n\nListen. Learn. Discuss.\n\nAt Ohio State, one thing we all have in common is that we chose to be part of this community. We can use this common ground to engage with each other in a respectful and caring way even — and especially — when we disagree. Listen. Learn. Discuss. is a developing Ohio State initiative that will help students, faculty and staff draw connections and form skills to create a wide, but still nimble, path that teaches and promotes more productive and respectful dialogue. We expect members of our communities to create an environment where trust and respectful dialogue are the expectation — not the exception.\n\nThe Listen. Learn. Discuss. website serves as a centralized online resource for courses, workshops, and events that give the university community opportunities to navigate difficult conversations, whenever and wherever challenging conversations take place — in the classroom, on the Oval, or in the workplace. The website includes an event calendar, through which university community members can submit opportunities related to the topic or the practice of civil discourse.\n\nNavigating Conflict in the classroom\n\nNavigating Conflict: A Toolkit for Instructors — instructional resources prepared by the Michael V. Drake Institute for Teaching and Learning. The Drake Institute supports all university instructors through its programming and resources, which include instructional consultations available to all who would like to discuss ideas, questions, challenges and concerns around teaching.\n\nManaging Conflict in the Classroom — a guide, provided by the Teaching and Learning Resource Center, focusing on classroom conflicts that involve offensive or disrespectful statements or actions towards individuals or groups of people, and that disrupt the effectiveness and safety of the learning environment.\n\nDuty to report\n\nLearn about your required duty to report incidents as an Ohio State employee. Note that all employers must report incidents of sexual assault immediately, and in addition, all university faculty must also report all incidents of discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct and prohibited relationships.\n\nIncorporating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into your work\n\nOhio State’s AI website – ai.osu.edu – provides useful information on what the university is doing and how faculty and instructors might use AI in their own work and classes. As a collaborative effort of several departments across the university, the site is a central point for faculty and instructors to find helpful information from the Committee on Academic Misconduct, the Drake Institute for Teaching and Learning (GenAI syllabus statements), and the Teaching and Learning Resource Center. It also offers links to training via BuckeyeLearn to help faculty and staff get acquainted with generative AI.\n\nNew Library Services Platform\n\nUniversity Libraries is migrating to a new Library Services Platorm (LSP) on June 25, 2025. This may impact links to catalog items and searches across syllabi and course materials.

Now conducting the process via a Maxient portal, an improved experience with increased transparency and more robust communication can be expected for all users.\n\nExcused absences for short-term illness\n\nEspecially during the winter months, please consider not requiring medical documentation for an excused absence from class for a short-term illness. Most cases of the flu and other respiratory illnesses do not require medical consultation but can be managed effectively with over-the-counter medication and rest. Requiring medical documentation can unintentionally encourage students to attend class even when they are ill.\n\nAdditional resources for undergraduate classes\n\nThe Office of Undergraduate Education provides additional reminders and resources for undergraduate class instructors.\n\nThank you for your commitment to serving our students and campus communities.",

    "content": "The special event, co-hosted by PLU alongside five other sister universities — Augsburg University, Augustana University, Concordia College, Luther College, and St. Olaf College — was made even more memorable by the presence of His Majesty King Harald V of Norway. The universities also partnered with the Norway-America Association (NORAM) as the local co-host.\n\nThe alumni gathering, held at Fanehallen just two days before Norway’s vibrant Syttende Mai Constitution Day celebrations, brought together over 300 attendees, including nearly 50 PLU alums and numerous members of PLU’s Scandinavian Cultural Center. This momentous occasion honored the enduring tradition of Norwegian students traveling across the Atlantic to pursue education, conduct research, and forge lifelong connections in the United States.\n\nThe event commenced with a distinguished announcement by the Royal Guard, signaling the arrival of His Majesty King Harald V. The program featured greetings from Eric Meyer, Deputy Chief of Mission of the U.S. Embassy in Oslo, and a keynote address by Ine Eriksen Søreide, former Minister of Foreign Affairs. Their remarks highlighted the strong diplomatic and educational bonds that continue to flourish between the two nations. The three-hour event provided an excellent chance for alumni from all six participating campuses to reconnect with old friends and forge new connections.",

    "content": "She studied in Seoul in 2022 and again in Busan in 2024. Each experience had its own feel and focus. “In Seoul, every minute outside of class was spent at museums, music festivals, and cafe-hopping,” she says. “Busan had a slower pace. Class in the morning, then afternoons studying, bouldering, or at the beach.”\n\nParadise’s willingness to say yes to what she loves has defined her time at PLU and beyond. So when the opportunity arose, she studied away in South Korea — twice! As a global studies major, she was drawn to South Korea’s rapid economic growth and soon found herself delving into U.S.-Korean relations and uncovering historical dynamics that have helped shape global politics.\n\nWhat makes Paradise stand out isn’t just her academic achievements — it’s her multidimensionality. She’s an activist, a makeup enthusiast, a newlywed who honeymooned in Olympic National Park, a gamer, a global thinker, and a former ASPLU President.\n\nParadise points to the South Korean flag; she studied away in Korea twice — first in Seoul, then Busan.\n\nIt’s not just war and policy that interest her; it’s power, resistance, and the stories that don’t get told. She explored those topics in South Korea, but it’s also grounded in her own history. “My interests are based on my decolonial lens as an Indigenous scholar. The fact that Korea has never occupied another country, but still competes on the world stage as an economic powerhouse, is compelling to me.”\n\nReflecting on the areas of interest she cultivated while abroad, Paradise shares, “The Korean War is one of the leading interests of my studies. In the U.S., war is often glamorized. But in South Korea, I saw war framed honestly, as something horrific. That changed everything.”\n\nGladstone is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation and the Kainai Blood Band in Alberta, Canada. “My Indigeneity shapes the way I walk in the world,” she says. “I was always taught that the winner or the oppressor tells history, and that’s how I have always navigated the material I encounter; whether academically, professionally, or personally. In a way, I have a completely different perspective of America, its history, and its founding that challenges the narrative pushed by academia.”\n\nShe brought that lens for diversity and justice to her leadership on campus, serving in several roles within Associated Students of Pacific Lutheran University (ASPLU). “I started as a Class At-Large Senator, then a Class of 2024 Senator, and then was the Social Justice Director until running and being elected ASPLU President in the Spring of 2024.” Through her four years with ASPLU, she had the chance to advocate for her peers, shape campus policy, and organize initiatives that support equity, inclusion, and student well-being.\n\nHer work was bolstered by strong, steady support from faculty, like Dr. Ami Shah. “She gave me the tough love I needed when I was struggling,” Paradise says. “More than anything, struggling students of color need someone who believes in them and holds them accountable.”\n\nWith a foundation of support, and a jam-packed 4 years of experience at PLU, she’s stepping confidently into what’s ahead. Next up? She’s applying for a Fulbright to return to South Korea, and is eyeing graduate programs in law or international affairs. Even with these ambitious plans, Paradise is staying open-minded and lighthearted. “I want to learn and make as many mistakes as possible,” she says. “Our 20s are way less serious than people make them out to be.”\n\nWhat she’ll miss most about PLU is the community. “There’s something beautiful about living alongside other people and figuring life out in real time,” she says. “I’ll miss that, especially the DJS lounge. The community of queer students of color creates joy that will be hard to replace.”\n\nParadise Gladstone has never been one to pick just one lane. She makes space for all the parts of who she is, and the world gets someone who shows up caringly, fully, and authentically.",

Please convey this commitment to your students, both in your syllabus and in class, and encourage students to contact you individually if accommodations are needed.\n\nIn addition, when planning due dates for major assignments and scheduling exams, please consult the University’s Calendar of Holidays and Religious Observances, which provides an overview of major holidays and religious observances. This calendar serves as a guiding framework; this list is not comprehensive or exclusive. Not all students will need to miss class for religious observances, some religious observances occur outside the dates noted on published calendars, and some observances may require accommodation beyond excusing a missed class period.\n\nIt is important to remember that students, staff, and faculty within the same faith or culture may nevertheless have different traditions and observances, and I therefore ask you to consult individually with any student who requests an accommodation rather than make general assumptions.\n\nIf you have specific questions about how to provide accommodations, please review these Frequently Asked Questions or contact the Equal Opportunity and Title IX office at 612-624-9547 or [email protected].\n\nThank you for your work to create an inclusive learning environment for our students.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRachel T.A.

    "content": "Dear faculty and staff,\n\nWe face unprecedented challenges across higher education. The University of Minnesota—our university—is not immune to those challenges.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and complex.\n\nFunding from the State of Minnesota is uncertain and historically trending downward.\n\nWe have experienced significant cuts in federal research funding, and there is ongoing uncertainty in the future of federal funding and international student enrollment. Inside the University, some have seen their employment end as a result of cuts in federal funding. Further, some key areas that determine our long-term success have been historically underinvested in.\n\nOur best response to meeting these challenges is continuing to come together in support of the University of Minnesota's mission. We must do so with a focus on financial sustainability and strategic investment.\n\nThank you for your commitment, hard work and partnership throughout the academic year to ensure that the University continues to serve our students, our state, the nation and world.\n\nThank you to the academic leaders, chancellors and their impacted units and communities who have answered the call this winter to take steps to limit expenses and manage the budget, making difficult decisions on program and scope reductions to meet current budget needs. It is inevitable that the difficult, yet necessary decisions made by deans and unit leaders to balance their budgets will further reduce our workforce over the coming year.\n\nThere’s more work to do. Now, more than ever, it’s essential that we double down on our efforts to ensure the University maintains its financial sustainability. Late next week, we will present the Board of Regents with our recommendations for a FY’26 budget. The recommendations acknowledge the very real challenges we face today, while positioning the University for future excellence and to best support you and your work.\n\nMaintaining the status quo is not an option. To ensure the University is on a path to short- and long-term financial sustainability, our response to this historic time will continue to be multifaceted.\n\nWe need to remain diligent in efforts to limit expenses and be thoughtful in formulating new strategies that prioritize our core mission, and assess our assets to best position our institution for success.\n\nAdvancing our mission in this climate will mean making thoughtful, targeted investments to best serve our students. Supporting our workforce is essential. Over the years, our salary increases have not kept pace with inflation. In early May, the Office of Human Resources shared its recommendation for a three percent merit pool increase that will be included in the FY’26 budget recommendation to the Board of Regents. How this merit pool is distributed will be decided by each campus, college, or administrative unit. Further, we recognize the financial sustainability measures we’re taking will, over time, mean a smaller University workforce. We remain strongly committed to supporting our people as they carry out our daily mission.\n\nWe must also take proactive steps to build a shared philosophy and protocol relative to hiring of new faculty and staff across the University. We will continue to hire some new faculty and staff, but with renewed prioritization in areas of key mission and strategic focus. We will share more details on this hiring protocol in the coming weeks.\n\nAt the same time, we will have to be even more focused on growing new revenue streams. The University of Minnesota Foundation is identifying broad-based and targeted philanthropic strategies to raise funds to help bridge funding gaps for critical initiatives and support our faculty facing abrupt fiscal challenges. We will continue to seek out external partners with common research goals.\n\nWhile we are strongly committed to keeping a University of Minnesota education affordable, including efforts to minimize student debt, we should expect that in this environment, tuition will increase next year. We will continue to prioritize financial aid and scholarships to students and families with the greatest need as we remain focused on providing an affordable, accessible world-class education.\n\nFor nearly a thousand years, universities have brought together scholars and teachers to challenge assumptions, exchange ideas, and share knowledge with the world. The University of Minnesota has thrived for 170 years. We are here for the long run and with a laser focus on innovation in advancing our core mission, we will emerge from these challenging times stronger.\n\nWith your continued dedication and partnership, we will continue to grow in excellence, serving Minnesota, our nation and the world for many generations to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Cunningham\n\nPresident",

    "content": "This message is being sent to all staff, faculty and academic personnel across the University of Washington, with the exception of UW Medicine clinical locations.\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nAs we approach the end of the academic year, we continue to monitor developments at the federal level related to research funding and other policies affecting the University. I am writing to update you on the current federal landscape and actions UW leaders are taking to plan for contingences and make financial decisions during a continuously evolving situation.\n\nOver the past few months, the UW, along with other universities and federal funding recipients, has experienced delays in award notices, non-competitive renewals and the issuance of funds. Across the federal enterprise, many UW grantees are having grants and contracts canceled, paused or terminated. Additionally, several federal agencies have proposed implementing facilities and administrative cost reimbursement caps of 15%, though many of these actions have been temporarily blocked by federal judges.\n\nThe UW has dedicated significant time and resources toward understanding these issues and their impacts, and we will continue to do so. Over the past few months, we have taken a range of actions in response to these federal policy changes, including collaborations with Washington’s Office of the Attorney General and national organizations. As the federal government continues to increase directives and requests to universities, we are actively and continuously working to provide information about grants awarded to the UW and how we can best steward those funds. We are working closely with peer institutions, including on a simpler format for research reimbursement that we hope can serve as a model for the federal administration and Congress. I am grateful to all who have contributed to these significant and labor-intensive efforts.\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty will undoubtedly continue through the summer months. I urge you to stay connected and informed. This request is particularly crucial for those on nine-month appointments who receive federal funding and may need to address time-sensitive questions about grant expenditures or may be impacted by actions that affect federal funding. For example, we are expecting clarity on the action to reduce the National Science Foundation’s indirect cost recovery cap to 15% after a hearing on June 13 and will communicate additional guidance to investigators once that information is available.\n\nWe will continue to advocate for and work to protect the long-standing, productive and impactful research partnership between the UW and the federal government. At the same time, we must acknowledge the real impact these actions have already had on our University. We have and will continue to develop plans to manage announced agency actions.\n\nIn keeping with the innovative culture that defines our University, we cannot simply react to external changes. The time has come for us to be proactive in promoting resilience in our research enterprise as we navigate these changes, and we must do this work together to be successful. I have instructed the Deans and Chancellors to ensure that they have mechanisms in place for faculty consultation over the summer as this planning continues. I thank you in advance for your engagement in this important work on such an immediate timescale.\n\nFinally, I am particularly mindful of the impact the uncertainty in federal research funding may have on UW faculty working toward promotion and/or tenure in a mandatory timeframe, as outlined in the Faculty Code. For this reason, I have authorized an automatic extension of the promotion and/or tenure clock for one year for eligible meritorious faculty. The Office of Academic Personnel & Faculty is developing a process to implement this extension and will soon share the details with Deans and Chancellors. Faculty will retain the opportunity to undergo a promotion or tenure review in any year leading up to and including the mandatory review year.\n\nEven amidst these challenges, it is important for us all to take some time during the summer to rest and reset. And before we reach the summer, we will have many opportunities to find moments of joy, including celebrating thousands of our students who will earn their degrees in the coming days. They are a source of inspiration and pride for us all, and an undeniable representation of the immense impact that our University has on people’s lives and in the life of our state, nation and world. Thank you for all the ways you have supported them on their journeys to this milestone.",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nAs we close out the fiscal year, my optimism about Temple University and its future continues to grow. Even as higher education faces unprecedented levels of uncertainty, I know that we are equipped to overcome these challenges. And, as I shared last week, we will continue to be thoughtful and intentional in our approach as we navigate this ever-changing landscape.\n\nIt has been an exciting spring here at Temple. Last month, we celebrated the Class of 2025 and welcomed nearly 8,500 graduates to the Temple alumni family at the 138th university-wide Commencement. We also came together for the groundbreaking of the Caroline Kimmel Pavilion for Arts and Communication, a project that will significantly advance arts and culture here at Temple and also serve our North Philadelphia community and beyond.\n\nI am also delighted to share that The Fox Chase Cancer Center recently received official notification from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that the Cancer Center Support Grant, or “Core Grant,” has been renewed for another five years. This is a tremendous accomplishment, and it reaffirms Fox Chase’s status as an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, one of only 57 such centers in the United States.\n\nAnd, as you may have seen, the university is now counted among just 21 colleges and universities nationwide to receive a top designation in both research and student success in the updated 2025 release of the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.\n\nOver the last several months, we have made progress on several initiatives. Here is where we stand on these key efforts.\n\nStrategic Plan: This spring, we hosted a launch event, several town halls and listening sessions as we kicked off a significant update of our Strategic Plan. In total, hundreds of members of the Temple community attended one of our events or provided feedback online. It was terrific to see such enthusiasm and thoughtful participation, which illustrates how deeply our community cares about Temple’s future success.\n\nAs we enter the next phase of this process, we will now have two committees leading this work. The Steering Committee—which includes representatives from schools, colleges and administrative units as well as students, alumni and community members—will study the findings, surface opportunities and test new ideas. The Executive Committee will then build on this work to identify clear goals, measurable outcomes and a new set of strategic initiatives.\n\nA complete timeline for the Strategic Plan as well as information on these committees can be found here.\n\nOrganizational updates: We have begun the process of identifying successors for Senior Vice President and Provost Gregory Mandel and Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Ken Kaiser. The search committees are being assembled, and we are selecting search firms. We will be sharing an update on our progress soon.\n\nAs I first shared in December, we established the Office of Community Impact and Civic Engagement. This spring, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the launch of Temple’s Community Gateway. The Community Gateway and the Lenfest Center for Community Workforce Partnerships have increased collaboration across campus and helped hundreds of families in North Philadelphia.\n\nWhile the Community Gateway and the Lenfest Center are now a part of the Office of Community Impact and Civic Engagement led by Vice President Valerie Harrison, IDEAL will continue to be part of the provost’s portfolio. IDEAL continues doing the critical work of serving as a place where the unique perspectives of all students, faculty, staff and Temple’s neighbors are celebrated. Just as Temple’s mission of providing students of all backgrounds with affordable pathways to an excellent, life-changing educational experience will not change, so too will be for the role of IDEAL.\n\nAdditionally, Equal Opportunity Compliance, the Title IX office and ADA coordinator will now be part of the Ethics and Compliance Office led by Chief Compliance Officer Susan Smith. This will include Title VI investigations as well. There is natural alignment between these units and bringing the functions into one office will strengthen training, compliance and resource coordination.\n\nEnrollment: We continue to make significant progress toward our goal of building back enrollment. Although the fall 2024 first-year class size increased, our overall enrollment of 30,005 is still significantly lower than it was in the fall of 2017, when the total was 40,240. This decline of nearly 10,000 students translates to a reduction of approximately $200 million in gross tuition. Our expenses, however, have not declined concurrently.\n\nThis year, the university received 44,980 undergraduate applications, which represents a new record, and we are on track for a first-year class of over 5,000 students. Graduate applications have also increased, continuing the momentum from last year. For fall 2025, overall student enrollment is also expected to increase slightly, which is a step in the right direction given the large class that has just graduated. There is still a long way to go, but this is a great indicator that we are starting to build back the university’s enrollment.\n\nBudget update: Our financial outlook continues to be challenged, as we are facing a significant structural deficit that has been further complicated by uncertainty at the federal level. In April, we shared some of the immediate budget actions we were implementing and acknowledged that longer-term actions would be needed as we look to close the structural deficit. Over the past few weeks, I have held budget conferences with schools, colleges and major administrative units to review their budget priorities. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2026, every unit has been tasked with developing a plan to target a 5% reduction to their annual compensation spend. These plans are under review. To manage these shortfalls in the coming years, we are developing a multiyear financial plan that will align with the updated Strategic Plan and allow us to eliminate our structural deficit and invest in the future, especially in our academic programs. I expect to share additional details related to the budget next week.\n\nRCM review: The review of the Responsibility Center Management budget model continues to move forward. The Steering Committee has been meeting regularly and is working toward finalizing recommendations that balance financial sustainability with institutional priorities. More information on the review can be found here. The review will be finalized by August, and we will then work to implement a revised budget model for fiscal year 2027.\n\nPublic Safety staffing study: Over the last few months, we have been working closely with Healy+, a nationally recognized safety consultancy, to conduct a staffing study for our Department of Public Safety. While we had hoped that it would be completed this spring, it is imperative that this study is both comprehensive and informative. Once completed, I will share the results of the study with our campus community. The study is referenced in a recent Philadelphia Inquirer article, shown here.\n\nIntercollegiate athletics: Last fall, we engaged Huron Consulting Group to conduct a comprehensive review of our athletics program to help best position it to thrive in the ever-changing NCAA landscape.\n\nBased on Huron’s review, we now have several working groups collaborating to implement recommendations around generating revenue, improving operational efficiencies and supporting student-athlete success. We will also continue to prioritize what matters most, which is graduating student-athletes and preparing them for success after Temple. During the spring semester, our student-athletes posted an impressive 3.45 GPA as a group. Overall, we have a 93% graduation success rate (GSR) and for six straight years, we have posted a GSR of 90 or above.\n\nThank you for all that you do for Temple, and I will continue to communicate with you regularly throughout the summer. I wish you all the best as we head toward what I hope will be a relaxing and productive time for all of you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Fry\n\nPresident",

We welcome this news. The College will continue to monitor developments that might impact the SMC community.\n\nDear SMC Colleagues & Students:\n\nThese are uncertain times, with sweeping changes taking place at the federal level. Following the release of a memo from the White House budget office on January 27 about a potential pause in financial assistance, many institutions and agencies across the nation have been scrambling to evaluate the potential implications. We are waiting on guidance from federal granting agencies on how this memo will affect federal grants issued to Santa Monica College—the memo addresses federal agencies, not SMC—and will share that information when we receive it.\n\nHere is what we know right now: The federal financial aid SMC students are eligible for is still active and being provided per usual processes. The US Department of Education has officially confirmed that federal Pell grants and student loans will not be impacted.\n\nYesterday, a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration’s executive action ruling that courts need more time to consider the far-reaching ramifications. Santa Monica College continues to collaborate closely with the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office and other partners to assess the impact of this and other executive orders on our college community.\n\nPlease continue to monitor your SMC email for further updates; any future news and guidance that impact the college community and regular business operations will be shared as promptly as possible. This college stands firm in its commitment to maintaining a safe, dynamic, and inclusive environment, where each individual matters—irrespective of immigration status, race, ethnicity, national origin, sexuality, gender, religion, ability, age, or socio-economic status.\n\nWe appreciate your patience as we face this evolving situation. Together, we will get through whatever lies ahead.\n\nKathryn E. Jeffery\n\nSMC Superintendent/President",

We value each member of the SMC community, and we stand together in solidarity and support of our undocumented students.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nKathryn E.

    "content": "Dear SMC community:\n\nFirst and foremost, my deepest gratitude to each of you for your dedication, resilience, and flexibility during the recent fires that have devastated the Los Angeles region and upended so many lives within the Santa Monica College community and beyond. Your steadfast commitment to supporting SMC students and each other truly embodies the spirit of Santa Monica College. “SMC Cares” has proven to be more than a slogan—it is a way of being, of demonstrating that in times of great adversity, this community shows up for each other, and those who need our help. In the face of immense challenges brought on by these devastating wildfires, SMC faculty, classified professionals, and managers have risen to the occasion to ensure that instruction continues, vital services and business operations remain accessible to our community, and SMC students remain on track to fulfill their goals.\n\nWe understand the significant impact the wildfires have had on our SMC community, and steps have been taken to better comprehend and address those challenges. A survey was recently sent to students and employees to assess the wildfires’ effects, and we have also engaged in intentional outreach to those impacted. Tragically, some have lost their homes, and we are actively working to connect them with local resources and support services. If you or someone you know needs assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to your supervisor or a trusted campus contact. We are here for you.\n\nI also understand there are concerns about the smell of smoke and the presence of ash. Please rest assured that the health, safety, and well-being of our SMC community remain our highest priority. SMC has protocols for supporting healthy air quality on campus during a wildfire scenario and those extra measures have been taken by our Maintenance and Operations team. We have been closely monitoring overall conditions throughout each day, and our campuses remain within a safe range for the Air Quality Index (AQI). Additionally, HVAC equipment at all campuses use MERV 13 Filters and have been running 24/7 to ensure that indoor environments remain safe. For any outdoor activities or travel, you may request surgical, KN95 and N95 masks at the Receiving Department, between 7 a.m.- 2:30 p.m. If you require an N95 mask, please complete the attached form and bring it with you to the Receiving Department when picking up your mask. Departments can also continue to order masks for the department through Adobe Sign.\n\nWe encourage anyone with concerns or needs for additional support to speak directly with their supervisor. Your health, safety, and well-being matter to us. Thank you for your continued dedication to SMC’s mission during this challenging time. Please take care of yourselves, stay safe, and, if you are able, assist with relief efforts in your area. We will get through the days ahead, together.\n\nKathryn E. Jeffery, Ph.D.\n\nSuperintendent/President\n\nInformation for Voluntary Respirator Use",

Our team has continuously monitored police and fire information and as weather and air quality conditions have improved, Santa Monica College will resume on-ground classes, services, and business operations on Monday, January 13 at its Main Campus and all satellite campuses with the exception of SMC Malibu, which will remain remote. Because this is a dynamic situation, we recognize that conditions may change and ask our community to remain flexible and to closely monitor emergency alerts in your area and SMC updates.\n\nSupervisors and faculty, please continue to be flexible with students or colleagues who have been displaced or impacted.\n\nFaculty: Please continue to be sensitive to students who share difficulties they may be having with college work due to the fire. Flexibility on deadlines, due dates, and attendance will truly help impacted students navigate these difficult circumstances.\n\nTo help those who have been impacted by the devastating area fires, many in the SMC community have mobilized to create a comprehensive network of support and care for all those affected, both in our internal and external communities. For more information on disaster relief support including mental health and various community disaster relief resources, as well as the SMC Foundation’s Disaster Support Fund and ways you can help, please visit smc.edu/disasterrelief.\n\nSMC is following recommended guidelines for healthy air quality in determining to reopen or to remain remote. Please note that the smell of smoke does not indicate that it is unhealthy to breathe. For more information about the Air Quality Index, visit Purple Air’s website.\n\nStudents returning to the Performing Arts Center campus on Monday, January 13: Please note that the Santa Monica Police Department is using the PAC parking lot as a temporary command post and are there to provide support to the near firefighting operations. Parking for students who are going to class at that campus will be available in the rows nearest to Santa Monica Boulevard. We are tremendously grateful to all the first responders—including our own SMC police department and essential personnel—who have been working tirelessly to ensure our safety.\n\nWe continue to keep a watchful eye on conditions. Please continue to check your email, the SMC website and our social media channels to stay informed.\n\nSMC is here to support each other in these challenging times. We will get through the days ahead, together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSMC Senior Administration and Emergency Operations Team",

Last night, the court granted Harvard’s motion. This step by the court halts enforcement of the proclamation while our case proceeds.

    "content": "New Measures to Address Financial Challenges\n\nDear members of the Northwestern community,\n\nAs we have communicated since our financial update message in January, rising costs related to compliance requirements, health care expenses, litigation, labor contracts, employee benefits, and other forces have put an increasing strain on Northwestern’s finances. With the potential federal changes — including but not limited to a substantial increase in the endowment tax, constraints on our ability to enroll international students, caps on indirect cost recovery, and a likely reduction in overall federal research funding — we face serious financial impacts that must be addressed immediately.\n\nLike a number of our peer universities, we have now reached a moment when the University must take a series of cost-cutting measures designed to ensure our institution’s fiscal stability now and into an uncertain future. These are not decisions we come to lightly. The challenges we face are many, some of which have been building for some time and some of which are new. We have discussed these challenges with a wide range of institutional stakeholder groups over the past several months, including the Faculty Senate, Faculty Assembly and NUSAC, and the actions we are taking have been informed by those discussions.\n\nPreviously, we announced several measures, including a hiring review for staff positions and a 10% cut in non-personnel expenses. Today, we are announcing several additional measures that will be implemented in the coming months. These measures include:\n\nA 0% merit pool with no bonuses in lieu of merit increases\n\nReductions in administrative and academic unit permanent budgets, which are likely to include decreases in the total number of staff positions\n\nA faculty and staff hiring freeze\n\nChanges to our health insurance program to tame double-digit percentage increases in costs\n\nModest changes to our tuition benefits program that will not affect the tuition benefit for dependents of current employees\n\nAdditional non-personnel budget reductions, including a reduction in planned capital expenditures for buildings and systems, that will impact service levels offered by some central units\n\nMore information on each of these actions will be forthcoming in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nWe understand the impact these changes will have on our community. Our hope is that these measures will put Northwestern on a path to stability, but the ongoing federal funding freeze and other decisions emanating from Washington could require additional actions. We regret that the current period of uncertainty makes long-term planning exceedingly difficult.\n\nWe continue to fight in myriad ways to get our federal funding restored, and to minimize the impact on our community. That includes meeting with legislative leaders and government officials, collaborating with peer universities who face similar funding freezes, coordinating with organizations such as the Association of American Universities, and working with counsel to explore legal options. We hope and are reasonably optimistic that these efforts to restore our federal funding will bear fruit, but we have asked our deans and other academic leaders to work with us to plan for a variety of scenarios in case they do not.\n\nWe understand that none of this is news you want to hear — and it certainly is not news we want to deliver. Nevertheless, we feel that transparency is important so that everyone has a shared understanding of the challenges that lie ahead. As we navigate through this continually changing landscape, we will be guided by our University principles, as we messaged in March. Like each of you, we believe in the mission of higher education and commit to working with our academic leadership, our faculty, staff, and trustees to sustain and enhance Northwestern’s pathbreaking research and teaching. We owe that to our students and future generations.\n\nWe will continue to provide further updates as we learn more, and as decisions are made that impact you and our community.\n\nThank you for your continued commitment to Northwestern, especially in these challenging times.",

    "content": "Dear SMC Colleagues & Students:\n\nI am writing to acknowledge the events that began this past weekend in downtown Los Angeles in the wake of heightened federal immigration enforcement and the deployment of the National Guard. These actions have left many of us alarmed, dismayed, and deeply concerned; it is vital that, at this time, we recognize our responsibility to support our undocumented/mixed-status students and community.\n\nNow, more than ever, SMC reaffirms and stands strong behind its commitment to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students, regardless of immigration status, sexuality, gender/gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, disability, age, or socio-economic background. Know that we will continue to safeguard your rights and personal information at SMC.\n\nTo quote from a June 9 memo California Community Colleges Chancellor Sonya Christian sent to CEOs statewide, “We know from experience that the impact of federal crackdowns doesn’t stop at the businesses and neighborhoods directly affected. These tensions often spill over onto our campuses and into the lives of students who are working hard to build their futures.”\n\nStudents have diligently dedicated time and effort to reach the end of the Spring semester, also a significant culminating point in the academic journey of the graduating Class of 2025. On a related note, the Vice President of Academic Affairs has asked SMC faculty to extend flexibility, wherever possible, to those whose attendance and/or participation in final assignments/exams might be impacted by the unprecedented events taking place in the LA area.\n\nPlease make a note of the detailed support resources listed below the signature line of this communication.\n\nIn the days, weeks, and months ahead, please watch out for others as well as yourself. As many feel the need to speak up and take a stand, I urge members of the Santa Monica College community to choose peaceful protest as a means of exercising your First Amendment right. Please be safe while standing strong in support of our undocumented/mixed-status students & colleagues, and each other.\n\nMost sincerely,\n\nKathryn E. Jeffery, Ph.D.\n\nSuperintendent/President\n\n---Resources for Undocumented/All Students & Colleagues Below---\n\nResources for Impacted Students & Colleagues:\n\nReview SMC Protocols re. Federal Immigration Enforcement:\n\nThe College & its police department does not participate in immigration enforcement activity. Our focus remains the safety and wellbeing of the SMC community. Please take a moment to review the College’s established processes in the event of federal immigration enforcement presence on-campus and related resources:\n\nSMC Federal Immigration Enforcement Response Webpage (consolidates resources, details on how the College handles and protects student information, legal updates & more)\n\nResources Specifically Curated by SMC/Dream Resource Center Partners for the Undocumented Community:\n\nKnow Your Rights (KYR):\n\nNAKASEK, a social justice network, has a phone app you can download to access KYR information and legal resources in many languages. It also has a speaker feature that can announce your rights in English, if needed.\n\nSMC Red and Blue Cards\n\nYou can pick up red (or blue) cards from the SMC Dream Resource Center office (also at different programs/offices throughout campus). These contain basic constitutional rights information that you can carry with you to help you assert your rights if encountering ICE.\n\nImmigration Legal Services\n\nSMC & California Community College students have access to free immigration legal services through FindYourAlly.\n\nEmergency Family Preparedness\n\nHelpful toolkit with guidance for immigrant families to create concrete plans in case of an emergency.\n\nMental Health\n\nFor access to confidential mental health counseling and additional mental health and wellness counseling resources and information, go to the SMC Center for Wellness and Wellbeing\n\nDeportation Defense\n\nHere are some organizations that provide deportation defense assistance:\n\n~",

    "content": "Dear SMC Colleagues & Students:\n\nI am writing to acknowledge the events that began this past weekend in downtown Los Angeles in the wake of heightened federal immigration enforcement and the deployment of the National Guard. These actions have left many of us alarmed, dismayed, and deeply concerned; it is vital that, at this time, we recognize our responsibility to support our undocumented/mixed-status students and community.\n\nNow, more than ever, SMC reaffirms and stands strong behind its commitment to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students, regardless of immigration status, sexuality, gender/gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, disability, age, or socio-economic background. Know that we will continue to safeguard your rights and personal information at SMC.\n\nTo quote from a June 9 memo California Community Colleges Chancellor Sonya Christian sent to CEOs statewide, “We know from experience that the impact of federal crackdowns doesn’t stop at the businesses and neighborhoods directly affected. These tensions often spill over onto our campuses and into the lives of students who are working hard to build their futures.”\n\nStudents have diligently dedicated time and effort to reach the end of the Spring semester, also a significant culminating point in the academic journey of the graduating Class of 2025. On a related note, the Vice President of Academic Affairs has asked SMC faculty to extend flexibility, wherever possible, to those whose attendance and/or participation in final assignments/exams might be impacted by the unprecedented events taking place in the LA area.\n\nPlease make a note of the detailed support resources listed below the signature line of this communication.\n\nIn the days, weeks, and months ahead, please watch out for others as well as yourself. As many feel the need to speak up and take a stand, I urge members of the Santa Monica College community to choose peaceful protest as a means of exercising your First Amendment right. Please be safe while standing strong in support of our undocumented/mixed-status students & colleagues, and each other.\n\nMost sincerely,\n\nKathryn E. Jeffery, Ph.D.\n\nSuperintendent/President\n\n---Resources for Undocumented/All Students & Colleagues Below---\n\nResources for Impacted Students & Colleagues:\n\nReview SMC Protocols re. Federal Immigration Enforcement:\n\nThe College & its police department does not participate in immigration enforcement activity. Our focus remains the safety and wellbeing of the SMC community. Please take a moment to review the College’s established processes in the event of federal immigration enforcement presence on-campus and related resources:\n\nSMC Federal Immigration Enforcement Response Webpage (consolidates resources, details on how the College handles and protects student information, legal updates & more)\n\nResources Specifically Curated by SMC/Dream Resource Center Partners for the Undocumented Community:\n\nKnow Your Rights (KYR):\n\nNAKASEK, a social justice network, has a phone app you can download to access KYR information and legal resources in many languages. It also has a speaker feature that can announce your rights in English, if needed.\n\nSMC Red and Blue Cards\n\nYou can pick up red (or blue) cards from the SMC Dream Resource Center office (also at different programs/offices throughout campus). These contain basic constitutional rights information that you can carry with you to help you assert your rights if encountering ICE.\n\nImmigration Legal Services\n\nSMC & California Community College students have access to free immigration legal services through FindYourAlly.\n\nEmergency Family Preparedness\n\nHelpful toolkit with guidance for immigrant families to create concrete plans in case of an emergency.\n\nMental Health\n\nFor access to confidential mental health counseling and additional mental health and wellness counseling resources and information, go to the SMC Center for Wellness and Wellbeing\n\nDeportation Defense\n\nHere are some organizations that provide deportation defense assistance:\n\n~",

    "content": "As we conclude this academic year, and I conclude my time as University of Washington President, I’m overwhelmed with amazement and gratitude for this extraordinary University and the community of students, faculty, staff and supporters who make it so exceptional. I also congratulate our class of 2025 graduates on your outstanding achievements. Welcome to the ranks of the UW alumni! You’re joining an incredible community.\n\nI have been a Husky for nearly 40 years, and over the decades, I have seen our University rise to every challenge put before it. We have undergone tough times before, but unquestionably, we now face some of the most significant challenges in our institution’s 164-year history. I wish this were not the case, but I believe with all my heart that the UW’s mission of impact for the public good will endure thanks to all of you who show up every day to realize it.\n\nAs faculty and staff, you create the learning, discovery, innovation, community engagement, patient care and public service that improves lives and catalyzes generational transformation. You produce research that expands the bounds of human knowledge and scholarship that opens the door to new ways of thinking about and solving our most pressing problems. As graduate and professional students, you train to become skilled professionals in healthcare, education, social work, law, government, business, technology, the arts and more. Many of you found new companies grounded in pathbreaking ideas that originate here. As undergraduates, you come here to pursue degrees and experiences that will take you far. I’m especially proud that so many of our graduates put your degrees to work helping our home state of Washington thrive – as I am so often reminded when meeting UW alumni everywhere I go.\n\nIt has been a profound honor to serve this University and the people of Washington, and I will continue to support our public mission from a different vantage point as I return to the faculty. I offer my wholehearted support and enthusiasm for our incoming president, Robert J. Jones. His wisdom, experience and vision have prepared him well to be the UW’s 34th president. I’m honored to serve as his predecessor, and excited for our community to welcome him.\n\nI thank you all for the privilege of leading this great public university. It has been a journey that I never could have predicted, full of incredible highs (and yes, its share of sleepless nights), and I will always be proud of the impact that we created together. I look forward to our University’s next amazing chapter.",

You now have a grasp of the sheer number of graduates the University of Cincinnati sends into the workforce year after year.\n\nAs a university, there is no more valuable contribution we can make to society and the economy than that of a freshly minted, career-ready college graduate who is prepared to drive impact in the workplace. In nearly every conversation I have with CEOs and business leaders, one message is clear: They need a steady pipeline of talent.\n\nIf America’s economy is driven by human capital, then its fuel is the knowledge these talented individuals gain – through traditional higher education, yes, but also through workforce development programs, technical training and, of course, real-world experience. My point? Education and lifelong learning are as essential as ever to both powering the economic engine and driving personal growth.\n\nRead the full Cincinnati Business Courier Op-Ed",

    "content": "Dear Emersonians,\n\nFor those of you in Boston, I hope you enjoyed a beautiful Patriots’ Day and the excitement of the 129th Boston Marathon. In our own way, we too are nearing the finish line as we approach the end of the semester.\n\nThe weeks leading up to finals and commencement traditionally involve both stress and anticipation, and this year is no exception. At Emerson and colleges across the country, we continue our important work of instruction, scholarship, practice, and performance while simultaneously facing new and unprecedented external pressures. We also acknowledge that this week marks one year since last spring’s protests and the profound challenges they surfaced for our community.\n\nOne of the most significant issues facing higher education today is the impact of new federal actions on international students. We are now aware of three Emerson students whose visas have been revoked for reasons that appear unrelated to campus protests. It is important for us to come together in support of our international students because their presence and perspectives add so much to our community. We will continue to strongly support them in pursuing their Emerson studies while we work strategically and deliberately to protect their status and rights.\n\nDuring this time of uncertainty, Emerson’s leadership remains vigilant in assessing federal actions that could impact our future. We are actively collaborating with partner organizations and maintaining regular communication with institutional peers throughout the region and the country. Additionally, we are taking steps to strengthen our financial position against potential pressures we may face in the weeks and months ahead. As we manage these immediate and evolving challenges, we remain focused on our five-year strategic plan and our unwavering commitment to the core values that drive our inclusive and caring culture. Our ability to overcome challenges and realize our shared vision for the future strongly relies on community collaboration.\n\nThat vision is grounded in expression, one of our core values. As a matter of tradition, policy, and principle, the College strongly supports the right of our community members to express their views. We continue to encourage our community members to openly convey their beliefs within the reasonable limits of our expression policies, which are designed to prevent harassment and intimidation while ensuring safe operations. The College approaches discipline thoughtfully, consistently, and only when necessary, striving to do so with fairness and respect for our community standards and the individuals involved. Freedom of expression is strongly supported at Emerson, and disciplinary action is taken only in response to violations of policies or laws, not due to the content of a person’s views or beliefs.\n\nOne year ago, when protests occurred on campuses across the country, the Emerson campus experienced an encampment protest in Boylston Place Alley, where city jurisdiction applies. The encampment provoked strong emotions among participants and those affected, but also violated several city ordinances, including one that explicitly prohibits campsites in public rights-of-way. Despite extensive efforts to resolve these issues peacefully and without arrests, the interaction between protesters and city and state law enforcement became confrontational, resulting in injuries for both protesters and police. It was a heartbreaking situation that the College strongly sought to prevent.\n\nThis week of reflection and increased media coverage about last year’s encampment may be challenging for many in our community. We urge anyone feeling distressed to seek help through the Emerson Wellness Center and Student Care and Support for students, the Employee Assistance Program for faculty and staff, and the Healing and Advocacy Collective for everyone in need. The College leadership once again expresses gratitude to the staff and administrators who were present in the alley that evening and worked throughout the night and in the following weeks to support students from all backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nEmersonians are resilient and compassionate, and these qualities will carry us through this week, this semester, and this era of uncertainty into a promising future. We are at our strongest when we unite against the threats facing our mission, our values, and higher education overall. With your support and partnership, Emerson will persevere and prevail, enabling us to achieve our vision of being a world-leading college for communication and the arts.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJay Bernhardt\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Emerson community,\n\nI am pleased to announce that Dr. Brent Smith, Dean of the School of Communication and an expert in marketing, strategy, analytics, and business education, has accepted the position of Associate Vice President for Executive Education, effective July 1, 2025.\n\nA nimble and innovative Executive Education program is a key initiative of Extraordinary Emerson 2030, Emerson’s recently released strategic plan. Building on the strong foundation of our existing Professional Studies offerings, this division will offer non-credit courses and credentials to professionals looking to increase expertise in defined skills and advance in their careers. Taught by existing faculty, accomplished alumni, and other high-achieving professionals, our Executive Education courses will introduce Emerson’s expertise and brand to a wider market, bolstering the College’s financial health for years to come.\n\nAs Associate Vice President, Dr. Smith will collaborate with colleagues within the College, as well as partners from various industries, to identify, develop, and administer quality, in-demand executive courses and certificates. The program, scheduled to launch in Spring 2026, will build on the talent and experience of the Emerson community while enhancing the reputation and influence of the College.\n\n“Several years ago, I embarked upon my journey with Emerson, finding it to be an institution and a community with extraordinary potential. In this new role,” Dr. Smith explains, “I hope to help us reveal and realize the full value of that potential.”\n\nIn the coming weeks we will appoint an Interim Dean to serve for 2025-26, while the College launches a search for a permanent Dean. School of Communication faculty and staff are invited to share desired qualities for the Interim Dean as well as possible candidates to serve in this role by emailing me (alexandra.socarides@emerson.edu) no later than Thursday, April 17.\n\nDr. Smith has led the School of Communication since April 2023, and previously held the post on an Interim basis for 10 months after serving as Department Chair for Marketing Communication for nearly three years. During his time as Dean, he has proved to be a transformational servant leader.\n\nWorking with department chairs, faculty, staff, students, and alumni, he has strengthened the School’s academic programs, resilience, and sense of community. In a short time, he successfully centered the importance of gathering through hosting monthly lunches, sponsoring faculty and students at the SXSW festival, and renovating key learning spaces for improved faculty and student experiences, among other initiatives. Dr. Smith has remained an active scholar, publishing peer reviewed scholarly articles and welcoming junior faculty as co-authors. He has fostered an entrepreneurial climate in the School of Communication, which has given rise to several faculty-sourced ideas, such as the Teach-In on Sustainability, the SOC Fall Writing Retreat, and the BCE Block Party. These initiatives aimed to create stronger connections between the School, the broader Emerson community, and the wider world.\n\nWith his expertise in business and in developing undergraduate, graduate, executive, and online curriculum; his experience in creating academic programs; his scholarship on marketing, ethics, and education; and his demonstrated collaborative leadership, Dr. Smith is well poised to lead this exciting new initiative.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Dr. Smith on this exciting and well-deserved appointment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlexandra Socarides\n\nProvost and Vice President for Academic Affairs",

    "content": "Dear Emersonians,\n\nAs we continue to navigate an ever-changing landscape, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the resilience and compassion that define our community. Your commitment to supporting one another and staying focused on our shared values and priorities truly makes a difference. This era of uncertainty has accelerated and intensified since my last campus-wide update, causing anxiety and stress among many. In the face of these challenges, the College leadership remains vigilant in monitoring the evolving actions from the federal government that directly affect Emerson and higher education more broadly.\n\nWe are especially focused on supporting our international students during this time of significant pressure and risk. We recently learned that one of our international students had their student status revoked by DHS in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). We are working closely with the affected student, who has requested that our community respect their privacy, to provide support during this difficult time. It is important to note that we have no reason to believe that this student was targeted for protest-related activity. We ask for your patience and understanding in the days ahead as we actively manage these challenges while maintaining our unwavering commitment to remaining an inclusive and caring community.\n\nAs we enter this final month of the academic year, I encourage everyone in our community to do their best to remain focused on what matters most: academics, enrollment, and supporting one another. I also urge our community to resist the external and internal pressures that seek to inflame and divide us. Emersonians are creative, compassionate, and committed, and our collective strengths and shared values will help us through even the most challenging times. If you need assistance, please remember that support is always available through the Healing and Advocacy Collective, the Emerson Wellness Center and Student Care and Support for students, and the Employee Assistance Program for faculty and staff.\n\nOur community has made much progress over the past year, planning for the future and fostering an inclusive environment that respects and welcomes diverse backgrounds and perspectives. I am inspired by our momentum and look forward to continuing our collective journey. Together, we can navigate this era of uncertainty and remain on a steady path toward Emerson’s extraordinary future.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJay Bernhardt\n\nPresident",

    "content": "Dear Emerson community,\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the College will extend the hours of the Lion’s Den space on the Boston campus for the rest of the semester. This change is being made in response to student feedback, including members of the Student Government Association (SGA), the student Presidential Advisory Group, and other student leaders, who sought greater access to community “third spaces.” The expanded hours will include weekend and extended weekday hours beginning Monday, March 17, 2025\n\nWe understand the importance of these spaces—places beyond home, work, or class—for fostering connection, creativity, and collaboration. The Lion’s Den has been a gathering spot for students, faculty, and staff, and by extending its hours, we aim to create even more opportunities for meaningful interactions, casual conversations, and community-building.\n\nWe also acknowledge that our off-campus students require additional space to gather during the evenings and on weekends. These extended hours offer more chances for commuters to meet, relax, and engage with the Emerson community outside of class time\n\nNew Expanded Lion’s Den Hours through the Spring Semester:\n\nMonday – Friday: 7:00 pm – 12:00 am (space open; kitchen closes at 7:00 pm)\n\nSaturday: 7:00 am – 11:00 pm (space open; Lion’s Den kitchen closed)\n\nSunday: 7:00 am – 7:30 pm (space open; Lion’s Den kitchen closed)\n\nPlease note that from time to time, the space may be closed when it is used for special events.\n\nWe look forward to seeing how the community utilizes this expanded access, and the insights we gather will help us determine future hours and opportunities for the space.\n\nWe are excited to implement this student-requested change and appreciate the passion and dialogue from those who expressed their support for it. We hope this expanded access enhances your experience and strengthens our vibrant community.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJay M.

    "content": "Dear fellow Emersonians,\n\nOn another blustery winter day here in Boston, I would like to extend my warmest greetings to our community on behalf of Emerson College’s leadership team.\n\nThis month, we find ourselves in an era of rapid change, which is inevitably leading to stress and uncertainty among many in our community and our broader society. As we continue to do our best to navigate this evolving landscape, we are guided by our many institutional strengths and united by our shared values, including our enduring commitment to building and sustaining an inclusive and caring community.\n\nSince the change of federal administration, the College’s leadership team has been closely monitoring the impact of emerging executive orders, memos, and letters, and the pressures they bring to bear. We are analyzing the implications of these many actions, including the Feb. 14, 2025, “Dear Colleague Letter” about DEI programs, and we are actively taking steps to protect the values and the work we are invested in while complying with legal requirements.\n\nEmerson is, and must always be, an innovative and inclusive institution where everyone belongs, feels safe, and can be their authentic selves. As a meaningful example of this commitment, Emerson will continue to strongly support our trans and non-binary communities by maintaining our existing policies and protections consistent with Massachusetts law. We also will offer our ongoing support to our international students and everyone in our community who may be affected by changing policies and pressures.\n\nWhile we remain focused on these developing challenges, our efforts must continue preparing for Emerson’s future success. After 15 months of hard work, including nearly 5,000 points of community engagement, I am pleased to share that the Board of Trustees unanimously approved our new strategic plan at their February meeting. Beginning in March, we will invite the entire Emerson community to engage with this vision, contributing insights and shaping initiatives. This plan results from extensive community collaboration, and we deeply appreciate the invaluable contributions of those who helped bring it to fruition.\n\nEmerson College is uniquely positioned to thrive at this moment in history because we champion the transformative power of the arts and communication to tell stories and create connections that advance society. We may be tested in the days ahead, but we will do everything in our power and authority to support our people, programs, and priorities. In times of division, our shared vision and values unite us as Emersonians and guide us forward together toward a brighter future.\n\nThank you for all you do to support our College, our community, and each other.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJay Bernhardt\n\nPresident",

We begin this term with opportunities that inspire us and challenges that test us.\n\nOur hearts are heavy for our colleagues, classmates, and alumni in Los Angeles who are facing the devastation of the ongoing wildfires. While our ELA facilities remain safe, many have experienced unimaginable losses. We will do everything possible to support our community during this crisis and on the long road to recovery. Please stay informed about developments at ELA and ways you can help. We are grateful to our leaders at ELA, the first responders, and everyone who works on all our campuses to help keep us safe.\n\nThis semester, Emerson’s vision for an extraordinary future will take concrete shape with the rollout of our new Strategic Plan, guiding us toward 2030. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the planning process through working groups, focus groups, interviews, surveys, online feedback, and earlier planning efforts. Your input has shaped our bold vision for the future and our strategy to achieve it. Once the plan is approved by the Board of Trustees and communicated to our community, your collaboration will be vital in realizing our ambition to be the world’s leading college for communication and the arts.\n\nThat future depends on a strong community, and we invite you to join us for upcoming events, performances, and discussions planned and curated under the EmersonTogether initiative. It is more important than ever that we engage in deliberative dialogue, support one another within our inclusive and caring campuses, and work together to uphold our shared vision and values. Thank you for your continued support as we focus on this year’s four top priorities: enrollment, community building, strategic planning, and communication.\n\nI look forward to seeing you on campus in Boston, Los Angeles, Kasteel Well, MCI-Norfolk, and beyond.\n\nHave an extraordinary and safe semester!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJay M. Bernhardt\n\nPresident",

It is hard to describe the chaotic scenes and the devastating feelings people, including many in Emerson’s extended community, are experiencing in this crisis. Our hearts go out to everyone affected directly or indirectly by these tragic circumstances, and we are grateful for the heroic work of our first responders.\n\nStrong winds and spreading fires last evening, including the Sunset Fire north of the ELA campus, led us to preemptively evacuate the ELA building as a precautionary measure. Several students, staff, and I relocated overnight to a downtown Los Angeles hotel out of an abundance of caution. I want to thank Tim Chang and Chad Hagan Myers, among many others at ELA and in Boston, for their work last evening to support and protect our students and staff.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has now lifted the Sunset Fire evacuation zone, including the area immediately adjacent to campus. ELA will operate primarily remotely today and tomorrow. We will continue to monitor the situation carefully and remain vigilant to protect the health and safety of our community. As of today, we expect all plans to proceed for ELA’s move-in next week, and we will provide timely updates as long as they are needed to ensure our community remains well-informed.\n\nPlease remember that many resources are available for those in need, both on the ground and through the Emerson Wellness Center, UWill, the Center for Spiritual Life, the Healing & Advocacy Collective, and the Employee Assistance Program.\n\nThank you,\n\nJay Bernhardt\n\nPresident",

He will begin his appointment on August 1, 2025.\n\nA nationally respected journalist with decades of experience across media, philanthropy, and higher education, Bolden brings a deep commitment to training the next generation of journalists. He currently serves as the CEO and executive director of the American Press Institute (API), an 80-year-old nonprofit that supports local and community-based media through research, programs, and data-analytic tools.\n\nAt API, Bolden has led efforts to foster healthy and responsive news organizations that empower communities to participate fully in our democracy. His vision for Berkeley Journalism centers on preparing the next generation of journalists to meet the evolving information needs of a complex, diverse society. That includes educating “complete journalists,” who will help rebuild the news industry, guide resilient media businesses and create meaningful feedback loops with members of communities whose voices have often been left out of the news and information ecosystem, while also upholding the excellence in storytelling that is a hallmark of Berkeley Journalism.\n\nBolden’s distinguished career includes roles at The Washington Post, where he led the award-winning transportation and development team, and at The San Francisco Chronicle, where he was director of culture and operations, one of the masthead editors.\n\nA mentor, educator, and advocate for inclusive journalism, Bolden has helped guide media leaders through social and economic disruption, bringing a strategic and civic-minded lens to every role he has held. He has served on the boards of the Society of Professional Journalists Foundation, the Student Press Law Center, and EdSource.\n\nBolden holds a Master of Liberal Arts from Stanford University and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Alabama. His broad experience, passion for public-interest journalism, and commitment to cultivating the next generation of storytellers and media innovators will elevate Berkeley Journalism’s unique mission and public impact.\n\nWe would like to express our deep appreciation to the search advisory committee for all of their efforts in the recruitment process for this important role. We are also very grateful to Acting Dean Elena Conis, who has graciously agreed to continue in her role through July 31, 2025.\n\nPlease join us in congratulating Michael Bolden on his appointment and welcoming him to the Berkeley community. To learn more about Michael Bolden, please visit this Berkeley Journalism news story\n\nSincerely,\n\nRichard K. Lyons\n\nChancellor\n\nBenjamin E. Hermalin\n\nExecutive Vice Chancellor and Provost\n\nThis message has been sent to all faculty and staff, and forwarded separately to students in the Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.",

    "content": "Dear Berkeley faculty and staff,\n\nTo address security and privacy issues across the Berkeley campus related to the use of generative AI, we write to announce two tools that will become available to all Berkeley faculty and staff starting in June:\n\nZoom AI Companion provides discussion summaries and other meeting support features to meeting hosts and/or participants. Critically, these features require the host’s permission. See below for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nprovides discussion summaries and other meeting support features to meeting hosts and/or participants. Critically, these features require the host’s permission. See below for details. Google Gemini App is a mobile and web application that allows for generative chat using Google's AI, similar to Microsoft Copilot. Google Gemini App is included in our existing agreement with Google and, unlike consumer tools, is subject to the same data protections as other tools in our campus Google Workspace.\n\nBoth tools include data protection through UC Berkeley’s agreements with Google and Zoom: your data will not be used to train AI models and will not be included in other public AI query results when you use these tools while logged in with your Berkeley account. During the pilot phase, the tools went through privacy, security, and accessibility reviews. Preparing to provide these tools has been a collaborative effort with several campus partners, including the Office of Ethics, Risk and Compliance Services; People & Culture; Research, Teaching and Learning; the Information Security Office; the Provost’s Advisory Council on AI; and the Academic Senate.\n\nArtificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, has wide-ranging implications for our society that members of the Berkeley community are engaged in questioning, challenging, and shaping. Berkeley IT's provisioning of these tools aims to meet campus needs for new technologies while working to address various risks and issues, and ensure that the use of these tools aligns with the university’s values and core mission.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nSince May 2024, we have been gathering feedback about the Zoom AI Companion from more than 700 members in a pilot program. Starting on June 10, all users of UC Berkeley Zoom can enable the Zoom AI Companion features within their settings so they can use it in meetings that they host. The setting will be disabled by default, and anyone interested in using the features during meetings will need to enable it before the meeting. Only meeting hosts can approve and enable the use of Zoom AI Companion during meetings and the setting can be disabled by the meeting host at any time. Meeting attendees will see a notification if a meeting has Zoom AI enabled. The features available include:\n\nMeeting Summary;\n\nIn-Meeting Questions;\n\nSmart Recording; and\n\nWhiteboard.\n\nAlso, on June 10, faculty and staff can use the Google Gemini App by visiting gemini.google.com. Student access is planned for the fall 2025 semester. Providing access is not meant as an endorsement of these tools or encouragement for their broad use within the educational context. Rather, recognizing that there is a range in the pedagogical utility of generative AI tools, the use of Google Gemini or any other AI tool for course-related work is possible only when explicitly permitted in the instructor’s syllabus for the course. Additional guidance to instructors is forthcoming.\n\nWe understand that there are questions and concerns about risks and ethical issues related to the use of generative AI, such as: (a) the environmental impact (i.e., use of energy, water, and other resources); (b) biases that may be incorporated into large language models (LLMs) resulting in potential data inaccuracies; (c) the potential of AI use to inhibit the intellectual development of its users (e.g., by taking over tasks that develop/maintain one’s cognitive abilities); and (d) the uncredited use (some might say plagiarism) of vast quantities of creative and intellectual work, without the authors’ permission, in the training data for LLMs. However, we understand that the demand for AI on campus is increasing and many are already using non-Berkeley sanctioned tools, which carry significant risk to the privacy and intellectual property of users. By enabling UC-licensed tools, we hope to provide equitable and secure access to the Berkeley community, and an opportunity to engage in critical and practice-informed debate as well as in related AI policymaking.\n\nLearn More\n\nFollow Zoom AI Guidance & Best Practices - Review this guidance before enabling the new Zoom AI features. This includes restrictions on discussing sensitive information (classified as P3 and P4) and obtaining consent from meeting participants before enabling AI features in meetings. Like other UC meeting summaries and/or recordings, those created using AI tools are considered public records and are subject to the same disclosure requirements, where applicable. Handle information generated by the AI tools according to the applicable UC records management policy.\n\nLearn more about Zoom AI Companion - These features will be initially disabled for your individual Zoom Account. On or after June 10, you can enable the features in your Zoom web portal Settings, under the “AI Companion” tab. If you need technical assistance, please contact us.\n\nGet started with Google Gemini App - The Gemini App will be available at gemini.google.com for faculty and staff on June 10. To get started with Gemini:\n\nWe hope these will be valuable additions to the Productivity Tools and other AI tools available at UC Berkeley.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBenjamin E.

We write today to affirm our ongoing compliance with all relevant federal and state law, as well as University of California policies, and to reiterate your obligations with regard to compliance.\n\nFirst, before anything else, we want to restate that we have an unwavering commitment to the freedom to speak, learn, and discover; equitable access to the university and its programs; the constructive collision of ideas; respect for differences; integrity in research; and diversity of perspective.\n\nOn this campus, we advance and support these values through, among other things, programs that are compliant with state and federal law; of note, Berkeley has been firm in its commitment to anti-discrimination laws, including state and federal antidiscrimination laws and the provisions of Proposition 209. That law prohibits all State of California entities from engaging in “discrimination or preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, and public contracting.” Additionally, harassment of, or discrimination against, any member of our community is antithetical to all that we stand for.\n\nIt is important for all of us to continue to be diligent in complying with our anti-discrimination policies with regard to operations under the authority of you and your subordinates, and we remind you of your obligation to report any suspected noncompliance with the UC anti-discrimination policy to the Office for Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD).\n\nYou may forward this communication to leaders and employees in your unit who have programmatic and/or supervisory responsibility if that will be helpful to you in performing your duties related to compliance. If you or they become aware of a program under your or their purview that may not be compliant, that should be reported to OPHD.\n\nIf you have questions about your program’s compliance, reach out to Chief Campus Counsel David Robinson (dmrobinson@berkeley.edu) for assistance as soon as possible. Rest assured that our campus has no plans to shut down or fundamentally change programs that are operating in a manner consistent with law and policy. Berkeley would not be, and could not be, Berkeley if injustice and exclusion were ascendant values on our campus and in our community.\n\nRichard K. Lyons\n\nChancellor\n\nBenjamin E.

    "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nImplementation of UC Berkeley's hiring freeze starts April 11, 2025.\n\nDivisions have flexibility for staff hiring, with current searches proceeding. Exceptions for staff hires require meeting certain criteria, such as the position addressing critical needs, and/or funding from appropriate sources is available.\n\nAcademic searches underway can proceed. Certain academic positions are exempt from the freeze, particularly those related to instruction or funded by specific sources.\n\nDear UC Berkeley Community,\n\nAs you are likely aware, UC Berkeley continues to face budget challenges. As a consequence, for the upcoming fiscal year 2025–26 (FY 26), we previously set division-specific caps on expense growth as part of our strategy to address our budget challenges. Those caps remain in force.\n\nShifting federal policies have added new pressures to our budget, affecting UC Berkeley and other UC campuses. In response, UC President Drakeannounced a hiring freeze and directed all UC locations to develop workforce management plans to address potential budget shortfalls.\n\nDue to the differences among the campuses, campuses have been afforded some latitude as to how to implement the hiring freeze. In this document, we provide an overview of UC Berkeley's implementation, which commences on April 11, 2025. The guidance in this email is subject to change should further guidance be provided by the UC Office of the President or should there be further changes in the financial landscape.\n\nBelow is information on Berkeley’s implementation, first for staff titles, then for academic titles.\n\nHiring in Staff Titles\n\nEach division will have considerable flexibility to determine the best path forward with respect to staff hiring. Staff titles include Career Appointments, Contract Appointments, Per diem Appointments, Limited Appointments, and Student Employee (Casual/Restricted, non-academic) Appointments.\n\nCurrent Staff Searches May Proceed\n\nStaff searches that are already in progress (i.e., the job has already been posted, as of April 11, 2025) are authorized to proceed without further review.\n\nExceptions to the Hiring Freeze for Staff Titles\n\nAfter the hiring freeze commences on April 11, 2025, exceptions can be made for appointments that, in the view of the responsible division leader (e.g., dean, vice chancellor, vice provost, associate chancellor) or their delegate, meet the following requirements:\n\nThe role addresses critical needs, compliance or safety requirements, and/or advances strategic priorities; and The role cannot be filled by qualified, current staff who are able to take on additional duties on an interim basis; and The role is adequately funded within existing budget restrictions.\n\nExceptions Request Process for Staff Titles\n\nExceptional approval from division leaders, or their delegates, can be attached in HR Service Hub as part of the normal position request process.\n\nTracking of Staff Hires\n\nBeginning April 11, 2025, we will track all hires made in anticipation of an eventual data request from UCOP. We will use hiring data that is already inputted via HR Service Hub to automate the reporting. Therefore, it is critical to continue to input complete information, including the requisite approvals, into HR Service Hub. A submitter may attach a PDF email that shows the hire has been approved by the appropriate division leader or their delegate. If you have questions about ServiceHub, please contact your HR Business Partner. Talent Acquisition will work with the units that do not use HR Service Hub (e.g., ERSO and CalPerformances), to develop a method for tracking approvals and hires.\n\nHiring in Academic Titles\n\nCurrent Academic Searches May Proceed\n\nAll academic searches and recruitments that are already in progress as of April 11, 2025, are authorized to proceed without further review.\n\nExceptions to the Hiring Freeze for Academic Titles\n\nThe following academic positions are excluded from the hiring freeze, with some caveats noted where applicable:\n\nDeans and other full-time faculty administrative positions.\n\nAppointments to existing part-time faculty administrative positions (e.g., Chair, Associate Dean, Director); however, we urge you to consider consolidating or keeping vacant positions when appropriate.\n\nAll faculty and instructional titles (e.g., Professor series, Teaching Professor series, Adjunct Professor series, Professor in Residence series, Professor of Clinical X series, Health Sciences Clinical Professor series, all Unit 18 titles such as lecturers, teacher special programs, etc., and Extension instructors); however, we ask you to keep minimum enrollment levels in mind and staff your courses accordingly.\n\nAcademic Student Employees. For Graduate Student Instructors we ask you to keep minimum enrollment levels in mind and staff your courses accordingly. For Readers and Tutors, we urge you to consider consolidating or keeping vacant positions when appropriate.\n\nSpecialists and Advisors in Cooperative Extension (these positions are funded by the Division of Agricultural and Natural Resources).\n\nProfessional Researcher series, Project Scientist series Specialist series, and Coordinator of Public Programs series (based on funding provisions below).\n\nPostdoctoral Scholars (based on funding provisions below).\n\nGraduate Student Researchers (GSRs) (based on funding provisions below).\n\nWe note the following: there is already a stringent, centralized process in place for the review of positions in the Professor and Teaching Professor series, which takes costs into account; campus did an analysis of Unit 18 Lecturer hiring and planning in fall 2024; Adjunct Professor series and Professor in Residence series positions are term-limited positions based on their funding; Clinical faculty and Extension instructors positions are based on the revenues generated by the clinical and extended learning enterprises.\n\nBroadly speaking, positions directly involved in providing instruction, such as faculty, and directly supporting the provision of instruction, are exempt because we need to provide these services to our students. Likewise, leadership positions (e.g., Deans) are excluded because those functions are considered critical. Similarly, positions funded from sponsored projects are exempt in order to meet our project obligations to external funding agencies or organizations.\n\nAcademic positions are excluded from the hiring freeze if they are funded by one or a combination of sources:\n\nExtramural contracts/grants;\n\nGifts or endowments where the funds are restricted to only allow pay for the specified position(s); and/or\n\nOther faculty-designated funding (i.e., CF2 designated), such as: faculty start-up funds, faculty retention funds, research gifts, endowed chairs, “various donors” fund, FSREP savings, etc.\n\nThe cognizant dean is responsible for monitoring fund sources.\n\nExceptions Request Process for Academic Titles\n\nIf there is no applicable exclusion listed above, division leaders may submit their request for exceptional approval as part of the normal search process using UC Recruit for review by the Academic Personnel Office.\n\nTracking of Academic Hires\n\nBeginning April 11, 2025, we will use reports from UC Recruit to track all hires made in anticipation of an eventual data request from UCOP. In order to do that, all completed searches must be appropriately concluded in the system in a timely manner. We also ask that each unit track other efforts in connection with the hiring freeze, including keeping a clear record of all positions that are left vacant, consolidated, eliminated, or deferred beginning April 11, 2025.\n\nThank you for your flexibility and understanding as the university continues to adapt to both a rapidly changing budget and policy environment and new systemwide mandates.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBenjamin E. Hermalin, Executive Vice Chancellor & Provost\n\nMarc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration\n\nEugene Whitlock, Chief People & Culture Officer and Associate Vice Chancellor-Human Resources\n\nVictoria C. Plaut, Vice Provost for the Faculty\n\nHeather Archer, Assistant Vice Provost for Academic Personnel\n\nThis message was sent to all UC Berkeley faculty, non-student academic and staff appointments.",

    "content": "Dear campus community,\n\nAs you may be aware, four current and two former UC Berkeley students have had their visas revoked and non-immigrant status terminated by the federal government. We know this action is generating understandable concern and questions. While the campus is respecting the privacy of those affected by limiting the information that we release, we want to share with you what we are doing in support of our community members.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge there has been no federal immigration enforcement activity in-person on the campus, and we are currently unaware of plans for any future activity of that sort.\n\nFour of those impacted are currently enrolled – one is an undergraduate and three are graduate students. The other two are recent graduates engaged in the STEM OPT program that provides work experiences in their field of study.\n\nThese actions create an uncertain and challenging environment for our campus community. Your university supports, without reservation, the right and ability of immigrant and international students, staff, and faculty to participate fully in the campus experience.\n\nThe campus is supporting those affected in accordance with its long-standing procedures for visa revocations. We are providing those affected with resources to navigate the process and are encouraging them to seek legal counsel for guidance. UC Berkeley's International Office has been providing international students and others with guidance and information regarding changing federal policies and actions proactively and directly and will continue to do so.\n\nConsistent with policies and law governing the privacy of the records of individuals, we are not providing any information about the identities or specific circumstance of any of the impacted individuals.\n\nWe are committed to doing all that we can to support all members of our community as they exercise their rights under the law. In doing so, the university will continue to follow all applicable state and federal laws.\n\nBelow are resources that we hope are helpful. We will continue to keep the campus community updated about relevant developments. We are committed to upholding Berkeley’s Principles of International Engagement.\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nSincerely,\n\nRichard K. Lyons\n\nChancellor\n\nBenjamin E. Hermalin\n\nExecutive Vice Chancellor and Provost\n\nThis message was sent to all UC Berkeley students, staff, faculty and academics.",

The VC will be an active partner with the chancellor, provost, deans, and other senior leaders in the campus’s strategic planning, working with these leaders to design the philanthropic campaign that will support the campus's strategic plan. As a member of the chancellor’s senior management team, the VC will be expected to provide meaningful input on the full range of issues facing the campus; hence, contemporary and comprehensive knowledge of higher education is highly desired.\n\nBerkeley seeks a strategic VC who demonstrates a strong commitment to sustaining a world-class fundraising and engagement enterprise, someone who will guide a robust comprehensive program adaptable to a changing social, educational, and fundamental research climate, and an expanding role for the university to play in technological innovation. A data-informed risk-taker and decision-maker, the VC will implement the necessary enhancements to UDAR’s infrastructure and processes to best position Berkeley to respond effectively and efficiently to the evolving nature of philanthropy; to enhance donor pipelines at all levels; and to deepen the strong philanthropic ties between the university and its supporters. Working closely with the UDAR team, as well as with development colleagues across the university, the VC will build upon the campus’s remarkable momentum and philanthropic success, including building upon the recently concluded Light the Way: The Campaign for Berkeley, which raised more than $7.37 billion, the largest total in history for any public university and for any university without a medical school.\n\nThe search team has synthesized the information received through the listening sessions and the online survey. We have now produced a detailed VCUDAR leadership profile. Please feel free to share this profile broadly. In addition, the search firm will use this information to reach out to potential candidates. It is important that we build a strong and diverse pool of qualified candidates. Any inquiries, nominations, referrals, and CVs with cover letters should be sent via the Isaacson, Miller website.\n\nThis search process is following the standard process of all Senior Management Group (SMG) searches, including the need for Regental approval once a finalist is selected. Please review the SMG Search FAQ for more information.\n\nThe job announcement, including the leadership profile, timeline, and search advisory committee list are on the EVCP website. Questions may be referred to our campus’s SMG search manager, Kristine Lee Wilby.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRichard K. Lyons\n\nChancellor\n\nBenjamin E.

The workgroup is compiling this report to address whether UC should adopt a unified academic calendar, but it will not advocate for one calendar option over another. The UC Office of the President (UCOP) created aQualtrics online survey instrument, and we encourage you to read the draft report and provide input and ideas through Qualtrics. You can also provide feedback by sending an email to calendar@ucop.edu.

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nMost faculty are aware at this point that the federal government issued new guidelines for indirect cost recovery (also known as “Facilities and Administration” costs, or F&A) for all grants, present and future, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. I write to keep you apprised of the University’s efforts to understand the impact of this directive and take any necessary steps to contest it. This is a serious matter for all of our campuses, especially the principal investigators whose research depends on the maintenance of facilities and the availability of services to keep their work running smoothly.\n\nFor those who are not part of the sponsored research world, it may be useful to know that Facilities and Administration is a foundational element of funded research. Among other things, it covers the costs of research buildings, information technology, utilities, procurement of supplies, and payroll processing. It covers the cost of personnel who assure the safety of adults and children enrolling in clinical trials for cancer and chronic disease, the ethics teams that assure those trials are done safely, the data and privacy teams that protect our personal data, and the equipment that fuels the labs where discovery is occurring. The reductions will disrupt a critical relationship to the pharmaceutical and device industry partners who rely on our independent research and clinical trials to establish the efficacy of emerging treatments.\n\nThe F&A rate is negotiated with and justified by the NIH by each campus every three to four years. The rate employed in grant submissions and awards has undergone detailed scrutiny and is carefully audited to be sure expenditures align with grant commitments. These costs are carefully developed with both NIH and Congressional oversight. Abrupt changes to this funding will leave gaping holes in the budgets that support the facilities and staff where our research occurs.\n\nThis has been a standard practice for decades; all universities that receive sponsored research funding undergo this rigorous procedure and the result is a partnership between the federal government and higher education to develop and sustain the most advanced research in the world. Indeed, the results represent achievements all Americans can take pride in. From Nobel prize-winning work in biology, physics, and chemistry to life sustaining work in public health, medicine, and social science, the University of California has achieved its pre-eminent status as the most respected and accomplished public research university bar none. This research leads to treatments and cures for real diseases for real people, such as cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes, among others All of this is at risk as a consequence of the abrogation of commitments to support that work in the form of this reduction.\n\nWe would like to share with you what we can, to reassure you of our collective (campus-based and system-based) efforts over the weekend. That includes the following:\n\nWe are working in collaboration with the professional organizations we belong to, especially the AAU and APLU, to articulate a united voice nation-wide about the impact of the F&A reduction on the entire R-1 university world.\n\nUC Federal Government Relations (FGR) has been consulting with the California congressional delegation, Democrats and Republicans alike, to ensure they understand how serious this is for UC and for California.\n\nWe have provided a declaration to the California Attorney General’s office in support of a lawsuit brought by a number of state Attorneys General requesting that a temporary injunction be issued by the federal court in Massachusetts preventing the order from being implemented while its legality is considered by the courts. Attorneys General from 21 other states have joined this effort.\n\nWe have begun a coordinated effort to remind the public and policy makers about the critical impact of research on public well-being. Every campus can point to important advances in medicine, agriculture, data science, and a myriad of other fields that has led to technologies, medications, and other discoveries that have enhanced the health, longevity, and job creation that Californians depends on. While IDC itself is something of a technical and budgetary matter, the work it supports matters to all of us and is most easily appreciated by direct reference to research achievements.\n\nPrincipal Investigators preparing new federal grants should consult with their campus Office of Project and Grants for guidance on these matters.\n\nThe President, Chancellors, UCOP senior staff, EVCs, VCRs, and many others met throughout the weekend and will continue to do so as we work to sustain the research enterprise. Your support and engagement in this effort is crucial. We thank you for your attention and your own efforts to educate the students and members of the community about these vital needs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKatherine S. Newman\n\nUC System Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs",

    "content": "Dear Instructors and Students,\n\nThis year, Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, and Eid al-Fitr, a religious holiday Muslims observe yearly, will occur during the spring semester. Ramadan is a month where some Muslims observe fasting from predawn to sunset daily. Eid al-Fitr commemorates the end of this holy month. This year, Ramadan will take place from Friday, February 28 to Saturday, March 29, 2025, with Eid al-Fitr expected around March 29 (the precise date depends on when the new moon is sighted).\n\nWe write to remind you of the campus policies that outline the rights and responsibilities of both instructors and students with respect to course conflicts and accommodations of all types. The relevant policies are linked below and are also available via the Academic Accommodations Hub:\n\nThe Academic Senate has created guidelines for instructors and students to follow in navigating reasonable religious accommodations related to course requirements. The Muslim Student Association (MSA) has also compiled a student resource for Eid and Ramadan accommodations. We encourage instructors and students to work together constructively to find the best feasible solution in each instance.\n\nIt is helpful to students and instructors alike if course syllabi clearly state due dates for assignments, midterms, and finals, allowing time for any necessary adjustments. Students should note that it is their responsibility to inform instructors of their need for religious accommodation. We ask that students request accommodations no later than Monday February 3, 2025.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Berkeley Dining will provide a to-go option, available upon request, in all dining commons. A meal plan is not required to purchase meals from the dining commons—any guest can pay for individual meals. Contemplation and meditation spaces will also be available on and off campus.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBenjamin E. Hermalin\n\nExecutive Vice Chancellor and Provost",

    "content": "Dear instructors,\n\nOur campus places great importance on having inclusive classrooms that foster a sense of belonging for all our students. To aid you in that mission, we wish to remind you of some of the resources that the campus provides to help you ensure your classrooms provide equitable opportunities for student success, are inclusive, and foster belonging.\n\nStudents succeed academically when they feel welcomed and included in the classroom, in their academic programs, and on campus. Consequently, we cannot realize the levels of academic achievement to which we aspire, unless we are committed to advancing equitable and inclusive instruction. By making our classrooms more inclusive, we remove barriers to student success and provide more equal opportunities for all students to succeed.\n\nTo support our instructors in creating more inclusive classrooms, our campus’s Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) offers many resources that help faculty promote a sense of belonging for students, including a stated commitment to advancing teaching in the service of social justice. Inclusive teaching encompasses teaching strategies and approaches that take into account and welcome the wide range of identities, experiences, needs, and backgrounds that students bring to the classroom by creating a learning environment where all students can thrive. This can include course design and teaching strategies that you regularly incorporate into your class and a mindset of being responsive to student needs and current events.\n\nOnline Resources\n\nOnline CTL resources that may be of particular interest to instructors include:\n\nFostering Belonging in Teaching\n\nFlexible Instructional Strategies to Meet Students Where They Are\n\nGender Justice in Teaching\n\nDisability Justice in Teaching\n\nReflective Teaching\n\nIn addition, many valuable suggestions can be found in our University Health Services guide to Creating Healthy Learning Environments.\n\nConsultation Services\n\nFor instructors who wish to go beyond online resources, CTL offers a variety of consultation services by request, including one-on-one and small group teaching consultations, support for collecting mid-semester feedback, classroom observations, customized faculty group programs, and presentations at department meetings. We encourage all instructors to peruse these services and take advantage of those they would find helpful. Deans and department chairs may wish to consider inviting CTL consultants to present at college, school, or department meetings on topics relevant to inclusive classrooms and student belonging.\n\nProvost’s Teaching for Equity and Inclusion Faculty Course\n\nWe are also very excited that this spring will see the launch of CTL’s new Provost’s Teaching for Equity and Inclusion Faculty Course, which is designed to raise awareness of potential inequities both faculty and students face when engaged in the process of teaching and learning. This first cohort is currently full, but stay tuned for future opportunities to sign up.\n\nBest Practices\n\nAlthough this wealth of resources may seem overwhelming at first, keep in mind that developing a more inclusive classroom can begin with implementing a few new practices or straightforward changes. For example, some effective practices include:\n\nwaiting slightly longer after asking a question before calling on a student, to give more students an opportunity to contribute;\n\ngiving students multiple ways to contribute to class discussion, and not limiting participation to oral discussion; consider providing an alternative option for students to share their perspectives, such as by responding to an in-class writing prompt\n\ninviting students who haven’t spoken up yet in a class period to contribute;\n\ninviting students to introduce themselves to each other on the first day of class or in an online discussion forum, such as by sharing where they’re from and their goals in taking the course;\n\nusing discussion techniques that encourage students to talk in small groups before regrouping as a whole class, so that all students have opportunities to speak;\n\nlearning as many students’ names as possible;\n\nconducting mid-semester evaluations that provide students with a low-stakes opportunity to provide feedback that you can use to be responsive to their experiences and improve your course;\n\nusing in-class polling to gauge student learning and viewpoints, to show students they aren’t the only ones who feel a certain way; and\n\nusing a diverse variety of names and identities in hypotheticals, assignments, and exams.\n\nThe Academic Senate has also suggested that faculty consider eliminating curve-based grading when possible, as grading on a curve fosters a spirit of competition over collaboration; can make it more challenging to promote academic integrity; and exacerbates students’ stress and anxiety, among other downsides.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWe hope these suggestions inspire you to develop your own teaching practices as you launch into the spring semester. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to consult the Center for Teaching and Learning if you are interested in further support or thought partnership related to inclusive instruction.\n\nAs always, we are tremendously grateful for everything you do for our students, and look forward to a semester of continued academic success for all.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBenjamin E. Hermalin, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost\n\nAmani Nuru-Jeter Chair, Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate\n\nOliver O’Reilly, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education\n\nJenae Cohn, Executive Director, Center for Teaching and Learning",

    "content": "Dear Campus Community,\n\nWe are writing to share that Dania Matos stepped down as vice chancellor of equity and inclusion earlier this month to assume the position of vice president for diversity, inclusion and belonging at DePaul University in Chicago.\n\nThrough her three years of leadership and staunch advocacy, Berkeley established innovative programs and initiatives to advance equity-based policies and practices throughout the institution, including the strategic framework and praxis of our Thriving Initiatives. With her leadership, Berkeley earned its first Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award and has earned the title consecutively in the years since. Additionally, Berkeley also earned its first Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) Award federal designation and grant, marking a historic moment in our commitment to equity and transformation and establishing our campus as a Minority Serving Institution. Dania created B4: Building Belonging at Berkeley and Beyond, a campus and community-wide series to develop a deeper understanding of structural and internalized oppression. During Dania’s tenure, Berkeley also held its first Becoming an Anti-Racist Campus Virtual Symposium, an opportunity to participate in collective learning and conversations about UC Berkeley’s path to becoming an anti-racist campus. Dania's leadership led to many firsts at Berkeley.\n\nPlease join us in expressing appreciation for Dania’s leadership and service and in wishing her the best as she moves on to this next chapter in her career.\n\nFabrizio Mejia, who is currently serving as the campus's acting vice chancellor for equity and inclusion, will continue serving in this capacity. We are very grateful to Fabrizio for his leadership and service during this time of transition.\n\nIn the coming months, consistent with our recent standard nomination and selection practices for interim senior leaders, we expect to share next steps regarding the selection of an interim vice chancellor for equity and inclusion, and subsequently, information about a national search for the permanent position.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRichard K. LyonsChancellor\n\nBenjamin E. HermalinExecutive Vice Chancellor and Provost\n\nThis message was sent to all students, staff, faculty and academics",

    "content": "Dear colleagues,\n\nWe have both ethical and legal obligations to provide accommodations and other supportive measures to our students. We call your attention to important campus policies and guidelines concerning academic accommodations for religious observance, illness, disability, hardship, athletics, pregnancy, and other situations.\n\nAcademic Accommodations Hub\n\nThe Academic Accommodations Hub is the student and instructor portal for support resources and academic policies, including key information regarding academic accommodations as well as links to mental health resources, resources for survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment, and more. This hub is located on the website of the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost and may also be accessed through bCourses (click “Academic Policies” in the bCourses navigation bar). We strongly encourage all instructors to provide a link to the Academic Accommodations Hub in their course syllabi. The best place for that would be alongside where assignment due dates and dates for midterms and finals are given.,The Office for Faculty Equity & Welfare also has suggestions for referring to accommodations and campus resources in a supportive way on your course syllabus.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nBelow is more detailed guidance on some of the situations where requests for flexibility or accommodation are particularly common and important to prepare for:\n\nDisability Accommodations\n\nWe remind faculty that University and campus policies (including APM-015: Faculty Code of Conduct) establish specific requirements regarding classroom instruction, examinations, and disability accommodations. Instructors who need assistance with Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) accommodations can access a 10-Point Guide to DSP Accommodations. The guide provides information about common questions that instructors may have about implementing DSP accommodations. Use the DSP services request form to contact DSP staff and reach out to the DSP Faculty Liaisons with any questions.\n\nThe UC Office of the President (UCOP) has published guidance related to academic accommodations for students with disabilities. We recommend reviewing the guidance prior to the start of instruction. Instructors can also access a recommended training opportunity that is a 10–15 minute read and contains a six-step instructor checklist for preparing for an accessible semester. Instructors are encouraged to complete the deeper dive DSP online training “Disability, Accommodation, and Access in the UC Classroom” (visit the DSP Resources for Faculty webpage and click on the “DSP New Online Training” link).\n\nAccommodations for Religious Creed\n\nIn accordance with UC Berkeley’s policy on religious creed, instructors should consult the Calendar of Religious and Cultural Holidays prior to scheduling midterms and assignment due dates. The Religious Holidays Calendar—as well as the Academic Calendar and Student Enrollment Calendar—can be added to your bCal (go to the Academic Calendar webpage and see the “Add a Calendar to bCal” tab for instructions).\n\nAccommodations for Student Athletes\n\nPlease refer to the Senate guidelines for guidance on how to address scheduling conflicts for student athletes.\n\nIf you have a student-athlete in your course who has schedule conflicts due to university-sanctioned events (including practices and travel), then you will receive a letter outlining their travel dates. The student athlete should contact you before the end of the second week of instruction (for spring 2025, by Tuesday, February 4) with a letter that describes all foreseeable conflicts in which the student may be participating (including potential playoff and championship games), as well as a proposal to resolve these conflicts. If you believe the student-athletes' conflicts make it impossible for them to successfully complete your course, please inform the student as soon as possible.\n\nTechnology and Accessibility\n\nFostering an equitable learning experience for all Berkeley students and instructors by supporting accessible academic technology tools is a high priority. We strongly recommend instructors use Research, Teaching, and Learning’s supported learning tools which offer the benefits of accessibility, privacy, and security. By using RTL-supported tools, instructors can focus on teaching and learning, knowing they are providing a safe and accessible environment for all students. While alternative tools are available, they may not meet these critical standards. Instructors considering unsupported tools should consult with IT or the privacy office first to ensure compliance and must assume responsibility for reviewing and vetting tools for accessibility, privacy, and security. The campus is unable to provide any assistance for unsupported tools.\n\nGuidance for Digital Accessibility of Web Content\n\n\n\nRequired Training : In 2022, the campus entered into a Consent Decree with the Department of Justice concerning the need to ensure that web content is accessible to persons with disabilities. As part of the agreement, the Digital Accessibility Program has created a short mandatory training on this topic The training will be assigned to employees in the UC Learning Center this spring and again in spring 2026. You may also access the How to Comply with the Web Accessibility Procedures training now.\n\nAdditional Resources : More resources and educational materials are available on the website dap.berkeley.edu.\n\nThe Learn section provides guidance on the creation and remediation of accessible websites, transcripts, captions, and digital documents (like word processing, ppt/slides, PDFS, and spreadsheets), as well as digital accessibility basics that apply to all web content.\n\n\n\nThe Testing section provides information on Siteimprove for websites and PDFs, manual testing templates and guides, and the WAVE Evaluation tool.\n\n\n\nThe News & Events section provides information on upcoming and past news and training/workshop sessions.\n\n\n\nPlease email improving-accessibility@berkeley.edu if you have any questions or would like to meet with a digital accessibility specialist.\n\nImportant Semester Dates\n\nSee the spring 2025 Academic Calendar maintained by the Office of the Registrar for the latest calendar information (students in degree programs that do not align with the standard academic calendar should consult with their department). Below are some important dates in the semester:\n\nSpring Semester Begins: Tuesday, January 14\n\nInstruction Begins : Tuesday, January 21\n\nAcademic and Administrative Holiday : Monday, January 20\n\nMidpoint grading rosters open for instructors : February 24, 2025\n\nDeadline for instructors to enter midterm deficient grades : March 18, 2025\n\nSpring Recess: Monday, March 24 - Friday, March 28\n\nAffordability deadline for instructors to submit summer 2025 textbook adoptions to the CAL Student Store: Monday, March 3\n\nAccommodation deadline for instructors to submit summer 2025 textbook adoptions to DSP: Tuesday, April 8\n\nFormal Classes End : Friday, May 2\n\nReading/Review/Recitation Week : Monday, May 5 – Friday, May 9\n\nFinal examinations: Monday, May 12 – Friday, May 16\n\nThank you for your continued dedication, creativity, and flexibility as we begin the new academic year.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBenjamin E.

    "content": "Tennessee is growing, and with that growth come opportunities—and challenges. The University of Tennessee exists to serve the people of this great state, and today our role has never been more vital. From addressing workforce shortages to advancing cutting-edge innovation, UT is at the forefront of ensuring Tennessee thrives.\n\nMore than 60% of UT’s 450,000 alumni live and work in Tennessee, contributing to every corner of our state. As the largest producer of the state’s workforce, we’re training the next generation of health care professionals, educators, engineers and more. This is why we’ve set an ambitious goal of enrolling 71,000 students across our campuses by 2030—because, for Tennessee to grow, UT must grow too.\n\nTennessee’s economy has made a remarkable recovery in the wake of the pandemic, but we are still facing labor gaps because we don’t have enough workers with the right skills and education for those jobs. According to an annual economic report from the University of Tennessee’s Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research, Tennessee has roughly 165,000 job openings across the state in key industries such as teaching, nursing and manufacturing. Together these industries make up about 25% of our state’s economy, and each is expected to see employment growth this year. That’s why it’s crucial that Tennessee continues to invest in building a workforce that can meet the needs of today and the future.\n\nRooted in the legacy of the Morrill Act, which established land-grant universities like UT to expand access to education and drive economic growth, our mission remains as vital today as it was then. However, our greatest challenge in fulfilling this mission is addressing the critical infrastructure needs that will allow us to continue leading Tennessee into the future.\n\nThe University of Tennessee System spans an impressive 31 million square feet across 1,016 buildings—more space than all the state’s locally governed institutions (Austin Peay, ETSU, MTSU, Tennessee State, Tennessee Tech and the University of Memphis) combined. However, the challenge lies in the age of our facilities. With an average building age of 47 years, nearly 30% of our buildings are over 60 years old, and 28 have stood for a century or more. These aging facilities are a testament to UT’s legacy, but they also highlight the urgent need for modern infrastructure to meet the demands of today’s students and tomorrow’s workforce. Investing in upgrades and expansions isn’t just about maintaining our footprint—it’s about securing UT’s ability to lead Tennessee into the future.\n\nThe UT System is proud to play a vital role in educating and upskilling Tennesseans, attracting more students than ever, and preparing the next generation to thrive in high-demand and high-need industries. We are deeply grateful for the many partnerships and collaborations we share across the state, which makes this progress possible. Together, with continued support and investment, we can fill critical workforce needs and build a brighter, stronger future for Tennessee.",

    "content": "Every student has their own journey to higher education. Regardless of where a student’s journey starts, finding the right environment for their interests and needs is crucial to reaching their higher-education goals.\n\nThankfully, our state offers students a number of options all through one connected network: the University of Tennessee System. The UT System is the state’s flagship higher-education system, tracing our roots back to 1794. Today, we serve more than 62,000 students across five major university campuses at UT Knoxville, UT Chattanooga, UT Southern, UT Martin and the UT Health Science Center.\n\nOur footprint allows us to offer students different environments, experiences and opportunities across our schools, based on their specific needs. We have five campuses: one right for each student.\n\nUT Chattanooga offers an approachable campus feel with all the benefits of living in a big city. UT Knoxville provides world-class research opportunities in an SEC environment. Both UT Martin and UT Southern offer tight-knit campuses where students can build strong relationships with faculty and each other. And at the UT Health Science Center based in Memphis, we train most of the state’s health care providers, from future doctors and nurses to dentists and specialists.\n\nBut our mission to educate, discover and connect goes only as far as our ability to support our students. As the state’s public university system, we’re pleased to offer a number of scholarships and financial aid to students who qualify. Nearly half our students graduate debt free thanks in part to UT Promise, a scholarship program guaranteeing free tuition for qualified Tennessee students.\n\nChoosing to go to college is a choice that can have a lasting impact on a student’s career, as data shows Tennessee workers with bachelor’s degrees earn, on average, $1.4 million more in their lifetime compared to those with a high school diploma. A college degree still matters in 2025, and new data shows the wage gap between recent college grads and high school grads is growing.\n\nWhile degrees are what bring students into college, fit is what helps them succeed and graduate. That’s why we believe deeply in the importance of offering students different options, opportunities and environments to choose from, so they can find one that fits their needs, and thrive in and outside of our buildings.\n\nNo matter where students find their best fit, they graduate with the same pride and the same UT degree, joining a global network of over 454,000 alumni. A degree from the University of Tennessee isn’t just the culmination of years of hard work; it’s the beginning of a lifelong connection to an alumni network that spans across the world, a network that can open doors, provide opportunities and create lifelong bonds.\n\nThis bond goes beyond just a shared alma mater. It’s a connection rooted in a common experience, a shared set of values and a commitment to excellence. Our alumni excel in every field as doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs, artists, engineers and more. They are innovators, changemakers, and most importantly, they are leaders at heart, committed to making a difference in their communities.\n\nJoining the UT System means more than just earning a degree: It’s about embracing the spirit of Tennessee and paving the way for future generations. And, in the end, that’s the true power of the UT System: As alumni, you’re part of something bigger, a collective force to improve our state and the lives of others through leadership, innovation and service.

    "content": "Distinguished Professor of Turfgrass Science John Sorochan was featured on the Today show in a segment that highlighted the university’s pivotal role in preparing the best pitches for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 and FIFA World Cup 26.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of the Today show, June 11, 2025.\n\nFollowing the June 2022 announcement of host cities and venues for the FIFA World Cup 26, FIFA’s pitch management team launched a five-year research and development project with UT and Michigan State University. The initiative — now expanded to include the first-ever FIFA Club World Cup — aims to produce perfect playing surfaces, ensuring consistency and top performance for players regardless of climate or stadium type.\n\nQuality of Pitches\n\nIn February, FIFA President Gianni Infantino praised the groundbreaking research efforts during a visit to UT’s innovative turf research and development facility, located at the UT Institute of Agriculture’s East Tennessee AgResearch and Education Center’s plant sciences unit.\n\nInfantino was impressed by the progressive use of technology that can benefit both player welfare and the spectacle of 167 matches across two global tournaments.\n\n“The quality of the pitches is important for these two fantastic competitions in cities which all have different conditions — some are at sea level, some are at altitude, some are in domes and covered — so we want to make sure that the quality of the pitch is the same for all teams and all players in all cities,” Infantino told assembled media during the visit. “The quality of the surface, the grass, has always been of paramount importance to me. With our internal team at FIFA we have always been exploring ways to do things better, especially when you have a tournament that is lasting one month (or) a month and a half and is played in different cities. Our team investigated and found the best people in the world to help us, and it’s fair to say that with (FIFA Senior Pitch Management Manager) Alan Ferguson we had this vision and joined forces to do something where the focus is the World Cup and the Club World Cup but from which the whole world will benefit.”\n\nImportance of Consistency\n\nPrevious visits by FIFA delegations to UT and MSU occurred last year. In April 2024, UT hosted the inaugural FIFA Pitch Research Field Day, the first official get-together of pitch managers from all 16 host city stadiums and training sites. Representatives from FIFA member associations, confederations, leagues, clubs and industry suppliers were present as more than 200 turf specialists discussed the challenges and opportunities for the project. In October 2024 MSU hosted the second FIFA Pitch Research Field Day, where more than 40 specialized pitch managers and industry leaders discussed best practices, industry innovations and pilot program results.\n\nSorochan said FIFA’s support of cutting-edge research at UT and MSU will hopefully revolutionize the sports turf industry and leave a lasting legacy long after the FIFA World Cup has concluded.\n\n“The focus is on consistency and uniformity,” said Sorochan. “For 104 matches across 16 stadiums — including five indoors — at different altitudes, in different countries and on two types of grass — the goal is to make them play the same. So when an athlete is running and cutting — whether in Miami, Mexico City or Vancouver — they shouldn’t feel any difference underfoot. Likewise, when the ball strikes the surface and reaches them, it should behave consistently. That has been my vision and goal from the beginning. This is where FIFA has been incredible, investing in research and using evidence-based data to achieve the highest-quality pitch possible.”\n\nFIFA Club World Cup 2025 and FIFA World Cup 26\n\nThe FIFA Club World Cup 2025 will mark a significant milestone as it will be the first to feature an expanded format with 32 teams, including the winners of the four previous continental championships. The tournament kicks off June 14 with a match between Inter Miami and Egyptian Club Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. The tournament culminates with the final on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nThe FIFA World Cup 26 competition will take place in June and July 2026, with 48 teams playing across 16 cities in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

As Tennessee’s flagship research-intensive institution, our commitment to supporting and advancing national security through partnerships like this will greatly benefit our region and the nation.”\n\nIn addition to establishing the National Security Prototype Center, the agreement will allow Y-12 and UT to collaborate in other areas:\n\nRecruiting a Distinguished Chair for National Security Manufacturing to lead the NSPC program and implement effective collaborations. The position will hold a joint appointment at UT and Y-12.\n\nCreating shared facilities to advance NSPC objectives; UT and Y-12 will create shared facilities to house collaborative NSPC programs supported by the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Energy.\n\nLeveraging emerging technologies such as digital twins and extended reality for high-consequence industries. Both parties intend to play a national leadership role in the development and deployment of these technologies in high-consequence environments such as nuclear material and energy production and emergency response.\n\nDelivering hands-on education and training programs for the nation’s future-ready nuclear energy, security and national defense workforce. Programs will include science, technology, engineering, mathematics and areas related to skilled technical work and will be flexible and responsive to employer needs.\n\n“The capabilities and resources of Y-12 and UT are a perfect match to further the center’s objectives, including leveraging emerging technologies, including extended reality, for high-consequence industries and developing the workforce for nuclear weapons intelligence,” said Mary Helen Hitson, NNSA Y-12 field office manager. “The work that will take place at the National Security Prototype Center is vitally important to the security of our nation and the world.

We are excited to celebrate these scholars for the ways they have made a positive impact in their communities and for what they will accomplish in the years ahead.”\n\nThe university launched the Distinguished Tennessean Scholarship in fall 2022 with the goal of recognizing one student from each county across the state for exceptional academic performance, demonstrated community involvement and a passion for the Volunteer spirit.

Participants receive an endowed scholarship that covers tuition, fees, and room and board as well as a paid internship and a study abroad experience, with the intention to attract, cultivate and retain future Tennessee leaders.\n\n“Each year, we are inspired by the remarkable depth of talent, leadership and purpose among our applicants from across Tennessee and the nation,” said Patrick Akos, associate vice provost and executive director of University Honors. “This newest cohort of Haslam Leadership Scholars exemplifies what it means to lead with integrity, serve with compassion and aspire toward transformational impact.
